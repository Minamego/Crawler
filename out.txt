writer, Share this with, The Champions League quarter final meeting between Liverpool and Manchester City is not simply a domestic battle for a place in the last four of Europe s elite tournament, It is a confrontation between two of Europe s most charismatic high profile managers in Liverpool s Jurgen Klopp and City s Pep Guardiola, It is also a confrontation between the two best attacking sides in the Premier League with goals between them And Liverpool are still, So where will the key battles be and who will come out on top, Titanic clash between Klopp and Guardiola, Klopp s record of six victories in games against Guardiola with Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool in opposition to Bayern Munich and Manchester City respectively means he has the best record of managerial success against the Catalan, It hardly makes Klopp Guardiola s nemesis Guardiola has five wins and both have had success this season with City winning at Etihad Stadium in September before Liverpool came out on top at Anfield in January, Both managerial styles are so entrenched principles so firm that neither is likely depart from them even in a game of this importance, Klopp s Liverpool will go all out attack while City will play the possession game bolted on to the pace of a superb attack which is Guardiola s hallmark, Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson told BBC Sport This will be everything that is good about football We over hype many games these days but this is a game that cannot be over hyped, There are times people expect a classic and never see it but I would be very surprised if this is anything less than that when these two teams and managers meet with a place in the Champions League semi finals at stake, The hype is justified because they can t play any other way than by going at each other, I don t see anyone changing their style said former Manchester City and England defender Danny Mills, City will try to keep the ball from Liverpool Their defenders are getting better and better but they also have this ability to stop you having the ball, If you haven t got it you can t score and this is how Guardiola operates City can sit deep pass it around and keep the ball off you This is the extra defensive strategy they will have, And former Liverpool midfielder Jan Molby agrees that Klopp and Guardiola will not focus too much on the two league games this season, I think the two managers are so set in the way they play and approach games that it almost doesn t matter what happened in those games said Molby, I m not convinced Klopp and Guardiola are the sort of coaches who revisit games as much as other managers do, They look ahead They know what they ve got and believe if they get it right they will be difficult to beat, Yes they will pay some kind of attention but it is about them I do think the longer you can keep the game at miles per hour from end to end the better it is going to be for Liverpool but minutes is a long time, Who will win the battle of the attacks, The centrepiece of the strategies of Klopp and Guardiola is an attack that has the potential to outscore any opposition, Liverpool and Manchester City are the Premier League s top scorers with and respectively so this Champions League quarter final provides the perfect stage for the face off, Klopp s three pronged spearhead of Roberto Firmino Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah have scored goals in games in all competitions with Egyptian Salah scoring a remarkable goals in appearances, City s attacking quartet of Leroy Sane Raheem Sterling Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus have scored goals in games between them statistics that illustrate how heavily reliant Liverpool have been on their big three, Klopp s pressing game worked with success in the victory at Anfield and as the below heat maps show Mane Firmino and Salah not only contributed three goals in a nine minute spell around the hour mark but were also key to putting pressure on City s defence, Salah s work is more confined to the opponent s half than the tireless Mane and Firmino and he will carry the main weight of Liverpool s attacking hopes after a devastating first season at Anfield, It will give Liverpool and their fans great encouragement that their best players are in such brilliant form added Lawrenson Mo Salah just keeps scoring and seems like he can t miss, I ve heard people say Mane has not been the same as last season That s true because he was brilliant then but he s still been very good, But Roberto Firmino has been outstanding as well without getting the same recognition as Salah If Liverpool are to get through this tie he will play a big part, It is this trio that Guardiola and City will look to subdue but Klopp and Liverpool will be presented with a task that will be just as arduous, Mills believes this is one of the key areas with Liverpool unlikely to shut out City over two legs, He said We laud Liverpool s three front players and rightly so They have been exceptional particularly Mo Salah absolutely outstanding but someone like Sergio Aguero has been doing that for the past five or six seasons and they also have Kevin de Bruyne David Silva Leroy Sane Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus, And Mills is so impressed with the quality balance and variety of Manchester City s attack that he asks a question many would regard as unthinkable after one man s stellar season at Anfield, It sounds daft but would Mo Salah get in Manchester City s team All the Liverpool fans will say Yes of course he would Who would you swap him for Would you swap him for Sane I m not so sure, Manchester City have a fantastic balance going forward, And Lawrenson added We talk about Liverpool s front three being able to scare any team left in the Champions League which is true but you can say exactly the same about Manchester City This is the level we are talking about, Will Liverpool draw confidence from Anfield win, As Manchester City s brilliance has wreaked havoc throughout the Premier League this season they will be returning to the scene of their only defeat in the competition this season, So will this have any psychological impact on events on Wednesday, Liverpool will gain confidence from their win but it is highly unlikely a team of City s calibre and experience will have theirs reduced, And yet there is an element of the unpredictable about both league games this season with Liverpool reduced to men after Mane s first half red card for fouling Ederson at in what was eventually while City almost staged a late comeback with two late goals in their loss at Anfield, Molby said It is a lot more important to Liverpool knowing they can beat City than it is for City having to play the team that have beaten them, I think City are no longer in doubt about their qualities so the way they responded after that defeat was important They just continued as if nothing happened, In terms of Liverpool if you are playing a team that hasn t been beaten all season then you almost get to the level where you wonder whether it is going to happen but the fact that you have done it even though some people will view that win at Anfield as convincing and some will not it will be important for Liverpool to take that in the baggage with them They know they can beat City, Mills added Liverpool know they can beat City know they are beatable know if they get at them they can score goals against them, Of course it gives them belief Liverpool will go into the game thinking they can win it They have just got to be a little bit more savvy in that midfield and defensive area to shut up shop a little bit I think the jury is out on whether they can do that, City will have the confidence of knowing what they can do Liverpool will have the knowledge they can win but I doubt City will take much of that game into this one They ve won plenty of games since, Salah v De Bruyne the great personal battle, They are vying for the player of the year honours and have been the standout symbols of their team s success this season, It is fair to expect Salah and De Bruyne to have a significant potentially decisive impact on this quarter final, Molby believes minutes is simply too long for either defence to keep these two superb operators quiet, If you talk about who will have influence I think it is a massive thing for City that Vincent Kompany is back and fit said the Dane, Who is going to score goals for Liverpool You can t get away from Mo Salah he s just very good at what he does The opposition know what he is going to do but they can t stop him He is so quick so alert so sharp, And he believes the brilliant Belgian De Bruyne is a central figure in City s gameplan, He said Kevin de Bruyne takes responsibility because City want to play in a certain way Guardiola trusts him to get that going and that is his contribution, He may not have been as sharp as he was earlier in the season over the past few weeks but it is almost as if their job is done in the Premier League, I think there is plenty of time for both of them to make massive contributions, And on that player of the year debate Molby is prepared to make his choice, Well it looks like Salah will end up as the Premier League s top scorer but we have one of them every year Kevin de Bruyne has taken Manchester City points clear so I tend to sway towards Kevin de Bruyne, Who will come out on top, Liverpool and Manchester City both have heavy attacking weaponry at their disposal and the refusal of Klopp and Guardiola to ever take a backward step makes this a potential Champions League classic, But who will win it, Liverpool just a gut feeling said Molby, I think Liverpool are better at these games where you have to lift yourself and find yourself against better opposition I just think there is something in the club s DNA that means they refuse to give in, Klopp s record against Guardiola is good and City s recent record at Anfield isn t, There are a lot of reasons to be cheerful from a Liverpool perspective but I just have this feeling I would not have been as confident had Liverpool drawn other clubs, Don t get me wrong I am certainly not confident they will beat City but I have a feeling they will, However Mills takes the opposing view Liverpool are the only team to have beaten them but what s the aggregate score over the two games to Manchester City he said, Liverpool certainly have the ability to beat Manchester City and they have proved they can do it Their attacking prowess is second to none, The question is do they have the ability to beat them over two legs and play in a way that can get them through the tie, I just think about Manchester City all round and just look at their league position and the number of points over two games I cannot see Manchester City drawing both or drawing one and losing one, So it s definitely Manchester City for me, My Liverpool and Man City XI, Share this with, Find out more, Top Stories, Related to this story,

Tipsy passengers and overflowing bins might be some of the most grating annoyances flight attendants deal with But what can be even worse are the four S s stealing sneaking swiping and switching seats, While it s not always a problem it can definitely cause headaches for cabin crew, Most flight attendants don t mind if passengers change seats says Michael a flight attendant for a major USA airline Change seats in their own class that is Even then there are some seats that are still off limits, This of course all depends on the airline companies like Southwest Airlines and easyJet allow passengers to pick their seat once they start boarding But in all other situations passengers looking to sit somewhere else than they ve been assigned can quickly cause chaos, It becomes a problem when a passenger wants to move to the exit row on the plane Michael says describing those seats that have extra legroom Most airlines make people pay upwards of extra bucks to sit in those seats and charge them when they book the ticket It s not fair for flight attendants to move or let people move to these seats when one or more paid extra to sit there I personally don t let people sit there unless no one is sitting in the exit row, Extra legroom aside Desiring to sit next to friends family or coworkers is understandable But swapping seats isn t always that easy, Sometimes people will take it upon themselves to just have a seat where they want Michael says It s easier for us flight attendants to have them sit in their assigned seats until the person that was supposed to be in the seat they want shows up When they come and see someone in their seat it causes a more hectic boarding process and the passengers are now trying to work things out and it causes a mess, But it s not always about wanting to sit next to your loved one What about wanting to upgrade from coach to something more luxurious If there is an empty seat and the upgrade list is empty does that mean passengers from another section can relocate Not so fast, It s not fair for flight attendants to move or let people move to these seats when one or more paid extra to sit there, Sandwiched between economy class and either business class or first class is another price range tier often called premium economy class Sometimes when flying aboard large aircraft on major airlines there are noticeably different perks of wide plush seats that transform into comfortable lie flat beds Beyond comfort other bonuses may include early check in wider seats upgraded meals or snacks and sometimes even gratis cocktails or comfort amenities like a sleep mask or toothbrush In smaller aircraft that aren t flying long distances the most common benefit and for some travellers the most obvious is the added two to five inches of legroom As always the magic number depends upon the airline, As for the dream of getting an upgrade Most flight attendants will attest that first class is usually full, If there are any open seats gate agents usually upgrade frequent flyers before boarding Who gets the sought after upgrades Frequent flyers are the obvious first choice followed by passengers who may have traded their seat for a voucher and upgrade on a later flight, In addition to upgrades there s a science behind the weight distribution This important factor is called weight and balance and depending upon the plane size especially smaller regional carriers passengers may be asked to relocate at least for takeoff We asked a pilot to explain, As for the dream of getting an upgrade Most flight attendants will attest that first class is usually full, All aeroplanes operate in an envelope of stability To continuously stay in this envelope from takeoff to touchdown all weight and its location have to be accounted for says Darren Patterson a pilot for a major US carrier If you were to attach a string to the top of the plane and dangle it the center of gravity CG is the point where it is equally balanced Just like two kids balancing on a see saw he explains, Passengers who think their own weight doesn t make an impact on the flight may be surprised to learn otherwise, This CG continuously yet slowly moves throughout a flight as weight is shifted says Patterson Even the movement of a single person walking in the aisle can be felt in the flight controls and very minor adjustments are made to keep the aircraft balanced The largest loss of weight during any flight will be the fuel that is burned So there are both a balanced starting point for takeoff and an ending point for landing If both of these points are within that envelope you will always have a stable aeroplane, Have you ever noticed the flight attendants counting passengers before departure Other times some aircraft have software that intuitively reads distributed weight and compute the numbers electronically for takeoff while other flight crews have to do it manually, The very best time to switch seats is online before getting to the airport, If you ve ever been on a puddle jumper and had the pilots relocate passengers to another seat that means weight needs to be distributed for safety s sake The smaller the aeroplane the more dramatic effect any shift in weight can have Patterson explains On a large wide body aeroplane a single person can move rows of seats and the effect on the balance is negligible Have that same person move just a few rows on a regional plane or turboprop and the effects are far more dramatic possibly even exceeding the limits of the envelope, Thanks to the convenience of technology some airlines allow passengers to upgrade on the spot with a swipe of a credit card once onboard Yes the same little handheld device flight attendants use to charge you for your double gin and tonic has the ability to upgrade passengers right there, The very best time to switch seats is online before getting to the airport followed by meeting the ticketing or gate agents prior to boarding When there are empty seats it s tempting to move but there may be passengers still on their way to the aircraft Once on the plane the flight attendant is your final advocate and we recommend you stick to the old adage you catch more flies with honey than vinegar In other words request nicely and you might just score the seat of your dreams At least in coach, Follow BBC Autos, Explore the

your short and long term recall and it appears to help everyone from students to Alzheimer s patients, When trying to memorise new material it s easy to assume that the more work you put in the better you will perform Yet taking the occasional down time to do literally nothing may be exactly what you need Just dim the lights sit back and enjoy minutes of quiet contemplation and you ll find that your memory of the facts you have just learnt is far better than if you had attempted to use that moment more productively, Although it s already well known that we should pace our studies new research suggests that we should aim for minimal interference during these breaks deliberately avoiding any activity that could tamper with the delicate task of memory formation So no running errands checking your emails or surfing the web on your smartphone You really need to give your brain the chance for a complete recharge with no distractions, An excuse to do nothing may seem like a perfect mnemonic technique for the lazy student but this discovery may also offer some relief for people with amnesia and some forms of dementia suggesting new ways to release a latent previously unrecognised capacity to learn and remember, , The remarkable memory boosting benefits of undisturbed rest were first documented in by the German psychologist Georg Elias Muller and his student Alfons Pilzecker In one of Muller and Pilzecker first asked their participants to learn a list of meaningless syllables Following a short study period half the group were immediately given a second list to learn while the rest were given a six minute break before continuing, When tested one and a half hours later the two groups showed strikingly different patterns of recall The participants given the break remembered nearly of their list compared to an average of for the group who had been given no time to recharge their mental batteries The finding suggested that our memory for new information is especially fragile just after it has first been encoded making it more susceptible to interference from new information, Although a handful of other psychologists occasionally returned to the finding it was only in the early s that the broader implications of it started to become known with a pioneering study by Sergio Della Sala at the University of Edinburgh and Nelson Cowan at the University of Missouri, , The team was interested in discovering whether reduced interference might improve the memories of people who had suffered a neurological injury such as a stroke Using a similar set up to Muller and Pilzecker s original study they presented their participants with lists of words and tested them minutes later In some trials the participants remained busy with some standard cognitive tests in others they were asked to lie in a darkened room and avoid falling asleep, It seems to benefit young and old people alike, The impact of the small intervention was more profound than anyone might have believed Although the two most severely amnesic patients showed no benefit the others tripled the number of words they could remember from to placing them almost within the range of healthy people with no neurological damage, The next results were even more impressive The participants were asked to listen to some stories and answer questions an hour later Without the chance to rest they could recall just of the facts in the story with the rest this jumped to an astronomical fold increase in the information they retained The researchers also found a similar though less pronounced benefit for healthy participants in each case boosting recall between and, Della Sala and Cowan s former student at Heriot Watt University has now led several follow up studies replicating the finding in In healthy participants they have found that these short periods of rest can also improve our spatial memories for instance helping participants to Crucially this advantage lingers a week after the and it seems to benefit young and old people alike And besides the stroke survivors they have also found similar benefits for people in the earlier, In each case the researchers simply asked the participants to sit in a dim quiet room without their mobile phones or similar distractions We don t give them any specific instructions with regards to what they should or shouldn t do while resting Dewar says But questionnaires completed at the end of our experiments suggest that most people simply let their minds wander, Even then we should be careful not to exert ourselves too hard as we daydream In for instance participants were asked to imagine a past or future event during their break which appeared to reduce their later recall of the newly learnt material So it may be safest to avoid any concerted mental effort during our down time, Towards total recall, If you are interested in further low effort ways to boost your recall you may benefit from the following strategies, The exact mechanism is still unknown though some clues come from a growing understanding of memory formation It is now well accepted that once memories are initially encoded they pass through a period of consolidation that cements them in long term storage This was once thought to happen primarily during sleep with heightened communication between the hippocampus where memories are first formed and the cortex a process that may build and strengthen the new neural connections that are necessary for later recall, This heightened nocturnal activity may be the reason that we often by at New York University found that it was not limited to sleep and similar neural activity occurs during periods of wakeful rest too In the study participants were first asked to memorise pairs of pictures matching a face to an object or scene and then allowed to lie back and let their minds wander for a short period Sure enough she found increased communication between the hippocampus and areas of the visual cortex during their rest Crucially people who showed a greater increase in connectivity between these areas were the ones who remembered more of the task she says, Perhaps the brain takes any potential down time to cement what it has recently learnt and reducing extra stimulation at this time may ease that process It would seem that neurological damage may render the brain especially vulnerable to that interference after learning a new memory which is why the period of rest proved to be particularly potent for stroke survivors and people with Alzheimer s disease, Other psychologists are excited about the research The effect is quite consistent across studies now in a range of experiments and memory tasks says at the University of York It s fascinating Horner agrees that it could potentially offer new ways to help individuals with impairments to function, Practically speaking he points out that it may be difficult to schedule enough periods of rest to increase their overall daily recall But he thinks it could still be valuable to help a patient learn important new information such as learning the name and face of a new carer Perhaps a short period of wakeful rest after that would increase the chances that they would remember that person and therefore feel more comfortable with them later on Dewar tells me that she is aware of one patient who seems to have benefitted from using a short rest to learn the name of their grandchild though she emphasises that it is only anecdotal evidence, at Nottingham Trent University in the UK is also cautiously optimistic He points out that some Alzheimer s patients are already advised to engage in mindfulness techniques to alleviate stress and improve overall well being Some of these interventions may also promote wakeful rest and it is worth exploring whether they work in part because of reducing interference he says though it may be difficult to implement in people with severe dementia he says, Beyond the clinical benefits for these patients Baguley and Horner both agree that scheduling regular periods of rest without distraction could help us all hold onto new material a little more firmly After all for many students the improvements recorded in these studies could mark the difference between a grade or two I can imagine you could embed these minute breaks within a revision period says Horner and that might be a useful way of making small improvements to your ability to remember later on, In the age of information overload it s worth remembering that our smartphones aren t the only thing

records can Manchester City break, Share this with, Manchester City have broken several records already this season but perhaps the most significant could be to come this weekend when they face Manchester United, on Saturday their th league win of the campaign means they have one hand on the Premier League trophy Beat their city rivals at Etihad Stadium on Saturday BST and the trophy is theirs, That would be the earliest date the Premier League title has been won but that s just one of several records Pep Guardiola s men could break by the time the season is done and dusted, With seven games remaining here s what else they are closing in on, Most of those appear to be very much in reach for Guardiola s side, Ton up for Lukaku watch out Shearer, Welcome Wayne Rooney It s been lonely in the club, That s what Alan Shearer tweeted when became only the second player after the former Newcastle and England striker to score Premier League goals, Given the way Harry Kane and Romelu Lukaku are going the club could become a bit more crowded in a couple of years, Manchester United striker Lukaku scored his th Premier League goal in Saturday s win at Swansea becoming the fifth youngest player to reach the landmark, Perhaps what is even more impressive is the majority were scored for teams outside the top four, Lukaku has hit double figures in six consecutive seasons and has a goals to games ratio of goals in appearances, That compares favourably to Wayne Rooney s ratio at the point he reached Premier League goals but leaves him behind both Shearer and Kane, Should Lukaku maintain his current scoring rate he is on course to join the Premier League goals club by his th birthday That would make him a year younger than both Shearer and Rooney when they scored their th top flight goal, Lovren much maligned or rightly criticised, Life as a Liverpool defender must be tough at times, While the is happening at the other end of the pitch the defenders may never quite know if they are going to be starting from one game to the next, Having started in the defeat at Manchester United on March Dejan Lovren was left out of the squad for the win against Watford a week later then returned to the bench as Liverpool edged Crystal Palace on Saturday, Lovren certainly cops plenty of flak a fact the Croatia international bemoaned in an on Sunday stopping short of sticking on a T shirt with the words why always me on it, But maybe his ire is fair, Statistically Lovren stacks up pretty well against his fellow Liverpool defenders with only Virgil van Dijk making more clearances and winning more aerial battles He also started of Liverpool s match unbeaten run earlier this season, Lovren s trouble is that when he makes a mistake he a mistake His errors this season have come in high profile games namely the by Tottenham in October and the, Hope from history for Hughes, There was no new manager bounce for Southampton in the Premier League as Mark Hughes first top flight game in charge ended in a defeat at West Ham Hughes has now lost the first league game at three of his past four clubs, The good news for Southampton fans is he hasn t had to wait long for his first win That has without fail come in the game straight after that debut defeat But can he sustain that record with a trip to Arsenal up next for the Saints, And is there hope from history that Hughes with eight games remaining can turn things around for the Saints, In short not really, The chart above shows the points Hughes has picked up in his first eight games at the clubs where he has started with a loss, At Stoke and Manchester City he secured eight and points respectively but that came at the start of a new season When he joined a club mid season as was the case at QPR he collected just five, A similar return for Southampton and fans will most likely have to start thinking about trips to Ipswich and Sheffield, Losing in the th minute Get Defoe on, If it s the th minute of a game and your side need a goal you ll probably feel a lot more hopeful if Jermain Defoe is on the pitch, That s because the veteran Bournemouth striker is the master of last minute goals, The year old s equaliser in Saturday s draw at Watford was the th he has scored in th minute or later at least four more than any other player has managed in Premier League history, That might be something for England boss Gareth Southgate to ponder when he names his squad for this summer s World Cup, Share this with, Find out more, Top Stories, Related to this story, Also in Sport,

Three years on how are local groups paving a path for a cleaner and healthier future, We re about five metres away from the Mediterranean Sea To my right the Zouk Mosbeh power plant pumps out plumes of thick grey smoke into an otherwise bright blue sky The Jounieh Valley towers behind me over the coastline a metropolis full of hotels and entertainment venues just outside of Beirut To my left I can see some sort of resort in the distance But all I can smell and all I can see around me is rubbish, This beach has already been cleaned up times and had been cleaned less than a week before I stepped onto it with Joslin Kehdy the founder of Recycle Lebanon which arranges the clean ups Plastic is turning up on beaches around the world but the difference in Lebanon is that rubbish is also being directly dumped into the sea and coastal landfills spelling disaster for the shoreline s ecosystem and public health, when a huge landfill site closed and government authorities failed to implement a contingency plan in time to replace it dumping and burning waste on the streets became widespread The campaign group Human Rights Watch calls it, , But it s also forced environmental organisations to find surprising and much needed solutions in the face of slow political change and they re proving that a country that s only the size of Connecticut might be one of Earth s best playgrounds for environmental innovation, Kehdy tells me that calling her organisation Recycle Lebanon was a pun It s not just about introducing recycling initiatives it s about forming a new path for a country tackling corruption which she and other activists believe fuels the waste crisis The traditionally centralised waste management system in the country has very little sorting capabilities meaning that the money isn t in recycling it s in generating lots of waste they argue, In a list of countries the Corruptions Perceptions Index produced by the NGO Transparency International as the rd least corrupt nation out of countries in other words there are only countries where corruption is worse According to Lebanon s confessional power sharing arrangement that s the delicate governmental balance it s forged between the country s many sects fuels patronage networks and clientelism which undermines further the country s governance system, When the rubbish crisis first started it stimulated a civil movement protestors rallied outside the Lebanese government and Gradually this evolved into initiatives like Beirut Madinati a new political party and the which is currently campaigning against the government s proposals to purchase incinerators, The issue with incinerators is that it doesn t suit our type of waste says Kehdy Around of our waste is organic It s too wet to be processed in incineration Secondly as with most waste management methods incineration also requires strict sorting at source, It looks like literally everything is thrown into the sea, More than people have taken part in beach clean ups with Recycle Lebanon proving that there s an appetite for citizens and businesses to get involved They re totally zero waste too even the face masks that people wear are re usable and the filters recyclable We set up zero waste clean ups with signs so people can learn about the type of waste the process behind it where it gets recycled and how they can change the type of products they re consuming, Walking up and down this beach it s clear how much general living habits here influence the sort of waste that turns up We lose count of the small single use plastic espresso cups Having lived in Lebanon I know how the Lebanese like their coffee fast and furious You ll finish one little cup throw it into the bin and have someone pour you another There s no conversation about re usable coffee cups that many countries in the West are having now There are plastic bottles full of water the tips of hookah pipes toys and so many single use plastic bags I m also surprised by the amount of medical waste clothes and astro turf It looks like literally everything is thrown into the sea, A lot of the rejectable waste that Kehdy can t do much with gets sent to an organisation called Cedar Environmental run by Ziad Abichaker As well as providing composting facilities for Lebanon s organic waste they have built Material Recovery Facilities around the country which recover as much as possible from thrown away materials Abichaker has even set up glass bottle bins around Beirut and brings the thrown away glass to Sarafand a small town in South Lebanon where the glass is formed into different shapes by glassblowers upholding a tradition that s existed in the country since Phoenician times, For the objects that can easily be recycled by people Kehdy is opening a centre in Beirut called Ecosouk to provide a space where the rubbish from the clean ups can be sorted and processed It will be a centralised hub where Beirut s locals can find out for themselves what they can do and where they can take their recycling There will even be an open data source for people to access online and find out what green initiatives are happening in their municipality, We re on our way to the Ecosouk when our taxi driver throws some paper out of the window Kehdy is to say the least not best pleased I ask her how that makes her feel when she s dedicating her life to changing Lebanese behaviour around sustainability, It s okay because even if he threw it out the window and even if he threw it in his bin it s going into the sea Maybe a few years ago we could have been shouting at him telling him that s wrong But now the system is so broken that the government s dumping the garbage into the sea How are you going to get someone to not throw it out the window, One organisation hoping to prompt behavioural change or is Recycle Beirut a company that works with businesses like restaurants and schools as well as local residents You ring them up they come and collect your recycling and take it to their factory to sort and process it They hire Syrian refugees in an attempt to solve both the garbage and refugee crises Lebanon is trying to deal with, We believe in doing a social job in addition to an environmental job says Sam Kazak one of the co founders What we are doing is we re trying to create as many jobs as possible for refugees and for all vulnerable people in general Most of our workers are Syrian and Palestinian refugees They don t have any problem working in this industry, But there s one problem refugees often struggle to obtain work permits, We try to get work permits for our Syrian drivers but it s not working So every time the police stop our trucks they give us a fine and they impound the truck for a few days And every time the truck gets impounded many tons of garbage go to the wrong place Burning landfilling dumping in the sea He says these people want to live in garbage and similar to Joslin s Recycle Lebanon pun I sense that Sam isn t just talking about the rubbish on the kerb, When I m back in Beirut after my trip to Zouk Mosbeh my trainers unhappily covered in mud and garbage not sand from the beach I head to the American University of Beirut Since my last trip to Lebanon it s become smoke free anyone reading this who is also accustomed with smoking in the Middle East might be similarly flummoxed as to how a university managed to stop its students and teachers smoking on campus There are also new recycling bins dotted around the buildings It s a rubbish free haven in a rubbish filled city, In the chemistry department I find Dr Najat Saliba who back in wrote a letter to the rest of the faculties about solving the waste problem Everyone replied and she says this is how I became the spearhead for what we call the AUB taskforce to try to do something about what s happening or to help the government look into possible solutions, She is the director of the university s Nature Conservation Center as well as a professor of analytical chemistry and has led the university s research into Lebanese air quality Her team has already proved that those who live near garbage piles or open burning sites or indeed both are more likely to suffer from respiratory problems She s yet to publish data from a new study that connects garbage piles in the streets with higher levels of bacteria and fungi in the air that s breathed in Now she s concerned that bringing in incinerators will add to the air pollution, The problem in Lebanon is that we don t have labs that are equipped or can do the quality assurance and make sure that the fumes that are coming from the incinerators are safe And I m sorry to say that based on the practices of what we ve seen so far we don t believe that the government can follow up on assuring the quality control is going to be respected and up to the standards that Europeans follow, In a workshop that AUB presented about Lebanese air quality one of Saliba s colleagues in one of the areas that the government hypothetically would like to place an incinerator What we found is that the fume is going to cover the whole of the Beirut area Most of the residents in Beirut would be affected by the materials released by these incinerators, It looks like it will take years for Lebanon to clean up its act Saliba shows me out of her office and into a nearby lab that analyses air quality The scientists working hard there are not Lebanese just like Recycle Beirut s the plush campus at AUB is staffed by Syrians and Palestinians, I believe in this country insists Saliba This country will pick up will change It has started to change with the Waste Management Coalition who are trying very hard to reverse the clock It will happen We will have cleaner air, Call me a dreamer But I would like to dream that way, , Follow BBC Future, Explore the BBC]}}

cloning is becoming more common and cloning extinct species could be on the horizon Could parks and zoos for these creatures be round the corner, A traveller marvelling at snow leopards in a conservation park A foodie who wants to taste pangolins without breaking the law A game hunter tracking a black rhino which will be replenished after the kill, To some people these scenarios seem like dystopian nightmares To others they re exciting prospects And as the science advances they may be more feasible than they might first appear Some researchers are even exploring by, , A Jurassic Park situation of dinosaurs once more roaming the Earth remains a fantasy De extinction is incredibly challenging and it s not clear whether even can be recovered With current technology DNA samples only remain useful for about so theoretically we could clone a Neanderthal but not a Triceratops last seen million years ago, Woolly mammoth DNA is more accessible We have flash frozen mammoth samples and can implant the genetic material which are genetically similar We can t actually bring mammoths back in habitats resembling their original ones though where they could breed naturally, But scientists might eventually be able to do that with other species that died out more recently than mammoths This would involve mapping the entire passenger pigeon genome then mutating a common pigeon s genome so that it s akin to a passenger pigeon s Voil a cloned extinct species, The science has since Dolly the sheep was cloned in says University of Connecticut biotechnology professor Xiuchun Cindy Tian who is working on reactivating nucleus based DNA through cloning, Controversial conservation efforts are underway to By one estimate a woolly mammoth elephant hybrid is In Tian s estimation if there were sufficient political will and funding it would only take years to reach a situation where zoos are populated with rare and even endangered animals, We re already partway there In the San Diego Zoo planned to display a cloned gaur Indian bison named Noah although he died of an infection after two days The zoo later housed Jahava a banteng a type of wild cattle from South East Asia until Jahava broke a leg and was euthanised Jahava and Noah were both cloned using cells from San Diego s Frozen Zoo a from endangered animals, So the main obstacles may be financial and political rather than scientific Tian says, For one thing mortality rates for cloned animals are initially very high Reasons aren t entirely clear but likely include reprogramming errors essentially the donor egg cell s nucleus holds on to a kind of genetic memory and resists the replacement with the new genetic material Animals cloned through this process known as somatic cell nuclear transfer have to survive that first shock after birth Tian says If they do survive they re generally healthy, There are ethical concerns about producing animals with a high chance of early death or stress Still similar questions might be raised about producing livestock in general And the success rates are increasing In scientists used cloned embryos to get one successful Dolly Now if you do cloned cattle you can transfer cattle cloned embryos and get about cloned animals born says Tian That s an amazing change, Even so the higher mortality rates mean that cloning remains very expensive The only current productive use of animal cloning is for prize beef bulls whose genetic stock is valuable to farmers Tian estimates that the cost of cloning a single bull is at least Cloning wild or endangered animals would be even more expensive as we have less information about them and fewer specimens to use as tests, So from a scientific standpoint it s well within the realm of possibility to clone endangered animals and to a lesser extent recently extinct ones If that happens most of us won t have much contact with these cloned endangered animals on a daily basis But one area that might allow for wealthy individuals, From a scientific standpoint it s well within the realm of possibility to clone endangered animals, If you think your Instagram feed already is full of people showing off novel specialised travel experiences that will only increase according to experts like Daniel Wright tourism management lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire and author of Jaded travellers might pay through the nose to hunt cloned animals in South Africa eat cloned animals in Japan or spot clones of endangered animals while on safari in the US, Right now adventurous eaters in Japan eat fugu although certain species are threatened by overfishing and despite the of these pufferfish Controversially the Namibian government auctions off several permits each year to hunt the arguing that the money is essential for conservation programmes and only non breeding rhinos can be hunted Cloning could make both experiences accessible to more visitors, And of course zoos and safari parks around the world already display endangered animals Many of them participate in biodiversity programmes aiming to keep endangered animals or from becoming dangerously inbred as there are so few for instance, So it could be argued that applying cloning technology for similar tourism purposes is while expensive not hugely different from an ethical standpoint If it s harmful to support a zoo containing carefully bred animals that will spend their lives in captivity cloning doesn t change that, The appeal of future zoons is the ability to bring the passenger pigeon back as much as seeing the passenger pigeon Carrie Friese, One person paying close attention to these debates is Carrie Friese a London School of Economics sociologist and the author of Friese says that in traditional zoos animals are the stars they re the reasons people come But in future conservation parks featuring cloned animals she envisions the technology rather than the animals being the focus A de extinction park for instance would be about celebrating human ingenuity as much as marvelling at the animals The appeal is the ability to bring the passenger pigeon back as much as seeing the passenger pigeon, Like Tian Friese can see these experiences drawing tourists For instance some that Americans are more supportive of cloning technology when it s used for conservation than for any other purpose, The two researchers can also imagine people cloning endangered animals for food Tian s research has shown that the meat and milk produced by cloned bovines is safe for human consumption and is largely indistinguishable from non cloned animal products She recalls sampling beef from a cloned black bull in Japan It was delicious Many people stayed in line for seconds But food supply isn t the main use for animal cloning at the moment and some people may be anxious about the safety of eating cloned food, Humans should support and implement measures that aim for preservation of natural environments and to ensure animals and species do not go extinct Daniel Wright, Thus the most likely scenario for future cloned animal tourism remains a non Jurassic park Yet as Friese points out cloning practices raise complicated questions about authenticity and ethics Would a cloned Pyrenean ibex be a true ibex Could a cloned animal from a wild species be considered wild itself And if zoos and safari parks with access to the latest biotechnology become full of cloned animals in the future what would the impact be on low income countries that currently depend on tourism based around wild animals, These aspects are foggy but one thing is clear The hype around a costly biotechnological process shouldn t entirely displace habitat preservation and tried and true conservation practices As Wright puts it humans should support and implement measures that aim for preservation of natural environments and to ensure animals and species do not go extinct, Follow BBC Future, Explore the BBC]}}

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6], url_data=[Accessibility links, BBC navigation, Why is train seat fabric so ugly, The secret science and surprising artistry behind one of transport s universal truths, buses trams trains and other public conveyances we ride we are rarely left with a positive impression of the upholstery We typically leave an impression on the upholstery itself so we suppose that s fair As sure as roses are red and violets blue transport fabric is a multihued graphic abomination possibly crawling with pathogens, How does this happen we d like to know and is this simply the crossweave that we must bear The answer is as unsurprising as a congestion delay and as complicated as getting to LaGuardia on public transport, We ask a lot of transport fabric It has to be durable since each seat will cradle hundreds of backsides a day It has to last for years be easy to clean and it has to be able to resist or disguise stains both accidental and vandalistic It must also seem clean even when it s not be entered into the record as Exhibit A Perhaps most important it has to be safe Fire smoke and smolder can be deadly particularly dozens of feet underground in a poorly ventilated tunnel, Luckily there s a superfabric to save the day Moquette from the French for carpet is the famous weave of most British public transport and is the choice for other mass transit around the world Transport for London has historically adopted a wool moquette fabric says Harriet Wallace Jones co founder of UK based design studio whose scarves and throws are featured in art museums and chic boutiques and who also design for TFL Wool is naturally flame retardant and moquette is a pile fabric which has more durability than a flat woven cloth The fabric is usually a mix of cut and uncut pile which also makes it more durable, The pile resists stains since there s no flat surface but also hides small particulates that happen into it Various coatings make sure it meets safety standards and that it can be regularly and vigorously cleaned Even in less luxuriant nylon iterations it has a velvety texture to the hand and the eye and lends itself to intricate patterns, It s that last bit that can be a problem, A design for a high profile new railway coach is a tremendous get for a design firm like Wallace Sewell but an updated Tube coach isn t the typical assignment for a transport textile designer Instead most designers and there are hundreds around the world who specialise in this sort of textile are working on branding for private coach companies or on small municipal lines There design as a civic good may not be the highest priority, There are many routes into the design process says James Newton Director of Transport Sales for a British company that s been producing fabric for public coaches since then as Holdsworth Fabrics which is now a division of the larger textile concern A typical design job may involve the bus or coachbuilder the seat manufacturer a design team internal or external and representatives from the transport system itself with sometimes three or four representatives from each party working on the design The process can take months to two years says Newton Sometimes much longer The end result can be a classic example of design by committee with all the horror that entails, The most egregious examples come from private coaches Franchises change all the time and they do their own livery putting their own fabric on there says Newton A lot of them seem to want to fool you into thinking you re going on holiday every time to step on a bus so everything has to be bright and vibrant, Some public transport companies choose their logos as an ornament says Stuttgart based artist Menja Stevenson who has immersed herself in the study of transport fabrics quite literally see gallery below They repeat it on the fabric a thousand times and in most cases this doesn t look really well designed Or they ll combine black red and yellow stains and then add a neon green logo on top That is perfectly ugly isn t it, It s a trend industry now says Newton Transport fabrics follow fashion just like any other designed commodity with big name artists and textile designers fighting to create the next classic moquette But when fashion trends are less understated so too is the design of your subway seatback, Much of textile fabric s horrid reputation seems rooted in the s when public transport agencies decided to follow a trend that we as a species still feel a bit guilty about For a while the fabrics were in particularly bad taste says Newton speaking like a survivor of some devastating natural disaster There were lots of bright colors and browns and oranges It was the mid s before people started moving away from those hideous patterns, It is possible if difficult to envision in retrospect that those s styles were on point on the new spur line back in The problem is that fashion trends don t last as long as transport fabric which can have a lifetime of a decade or more In fact few coach refurbishments happen because the fabric wears out it s more often necessitated by disintegration of the padding beneath it Imagine then someone still rocking black lace fingerless gloves and some not so white anymore LA Gear trainers in and you have a pop culture picture of the design problem Couple that with the sheer ubiquity of the designs Camira delivers more than metres in a single year to pretty much every single country in the world and a typical commuter sees the same pattern twice every dreary day of her life and the reputation for ugly seating is set, For her Bustour project Stevenson dressed herself in clothing made of real transit fabric and then rode the lines the designs came from, For many years I had to take the bus to the academy where I studied art Such a pattern like a lot of everyday things imprints itself into our memory unconsciously without being actually perceived she notes Through my intervention the beholder or passenger becomes aware of the invisible fabric In her hand sewn clothes she was camouflaged in her seat but paradoxically became even more visible This is what I had in mind I wanted to get the unseen seen, These fabrics say a lot about perception and awareness she continues Many people aren t aware of many things If you think that people accept this ugliness of fabrics buildings public spaces etc then you re probably mistaken it s just that they re not conscious of it On the other hand the people who are in charge of designing such things should increase their awareness of them it is a major responsibility to put these things on display, The standard by which all other transport fabrics are judged is the London transport system They have always designed specific fabrics for each tube or bus line says Wallace Jones TFL prides itself on good design be it graphics product engineering or moquette which makes it completely unique embracing every aspect of the transport system and adopting a unique design aesthetic Wallace Sewell s Barman fabric pictured above does all of that and adds a as well, Transport London s moquettes are so popular that the patterns modern and historic are to the public Though it may seem improbable that someone would recover a sett e in Tramlink Priority one should remember that the British are inexplicably nuts for trains But looking through that gallery and even more mass market selections one can see the clear influence of such art movements as Bauhaus Art Deco Op Art and,

benefit your health it may help heal wounds resistant to antibiotics, As a child growing up in poverty in the rural Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe Moses Murandu was used to having salt literally rubbed in his wounds when he fell and cut himself On lucky days though his father had enough money to buy something which stung the boy much less than salt sugar, Murandu always noticed that sugar seemed to help heal wounds more quickly than no treatment at all So he was surprised when having been recruited to come to work as a nurse for the UK s National Health System NHS in he found that sugar wasn t being used in any official capacity He decided to try to change that, Now Murandu s idea finally is being taken seriously A senior lecturer in adult nursing at the University of Wolverhampton Murandu completed an initial focussed on sugar s applications in wound healing and won an award from the Journal of Wound Care in March for his work, Are you ready to unlock Britain s best kept secrets, London and surrounds offer an irresistible cacophony of nightlife food and drink natural wonders and world leading culture for you to check out We ve delved into London and its neighbouring cities of Brighton Bristol Liverpool and Manchester all within approximately hours to unlock their best kept secrets Whether you re in town for a couple of hours a few days or a week allow yourself to be swept up by Britain s allure, , , In some parts of the world this procedure could be key because people cannot afford antibiotics But there is interest in the UK too since once a wound is infected, To treat a wound with sugar all you do Murandu says is pour the sugar on the wound and apply a bandage on top The granules soak up any moisture that allows bacteria to thrive Without the bacteria the wound heals more quickly, Evidence for all of this was found in Murandu s trials in the lab And a growing collection of case studies from around the world has supported Murandu s findings including examples of on wounds resistant to antibiotics Even so Murandu faces an uphill battle Funding for further research would help him reach his ultimate goal to convince the NHS to use sugar as an alternative to antibiotics But a great deal of medical research is funded by pharmaceutical companies And these companies he points out have little to gain from paying for research into something they can t patent, The sugar is the plain granulated type you might use to sweeten your tea, The sugar Murandu uses is the plain granulated type you might use to sweeten your tea In the same in vitro trials he found that there was no difference between using cane or beet sugar Demerara however wasn t as effective, The pilot showed that strains of bacteria grew in low concentrations of sugar but were completely inhibited in higher concentrations Murandu started recording case studies in Zimbabwe Botswana and Lesotho where he first trained in nursing Included among them is a woman living in Harare, The woman s foot had been measured ready to be amputated when my nephew called me Murandu says She had had a terrible wound for five years and the doctor wanted to amputate I told her to wash the wound apply sugar leave it and repeat, The woman still has her leg, This he says is one example of why there is so much interest in his methods particularly from parts of the world where people can t afford antibiotics, In total Murandu has now carried out clinical studies on patients in the UK He hasn t yet published the trial results but has presented them at national and international conferences One question he had to answer during his research was whether sugar could be used on diabetic patients who commonly have leg and foot ulcers Diabetics need to control the level of glucose in their blood so this isn t an obvious healing method to use on them, But he found that it worked for diabetics without sending their glucose levels soaring Sugar is sucrose you need the enzyme sucrase to convert that into glucose he says As sucrase is found within the body it is only when the sugar is absorbed that it is converted Applying it to the outside of the wound isn t going to affect it in the same way, While Murandu continues his research on human patients across the Atlantic US veterinarian Maureen McMichael has been using this healing method on animals for years, McMichael who works at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital first started using both sugar and honey on pets back in She said it was a combination of the simplicity of the method and the low cost that attracted her especially for pet owners who couldn t afford the usual methods of bringing the animal to the hospital and using sedation, McMichael says that they keep both sugar and honey in their surgery and often used it on dogs and cats and occasionally on farm animals Honey has similar healing properties to sugar found it to be even more effective at inhibiting bacterial growth though it is more expensive, We have had some really great successes with this McMichael says She gave an example of a stray dog that had come to them after being used as pitbull bait hung from a harness and attacked by pitbulls being trained for fighting The dog came in with up to bite wounds on each limb and was healed within eight weeks, She was a stray so there was no money for her We treated her with both honey and sugar and she did fabulously McMichael says She s all healed now, As well as being cheaper sugar has another upside as more and more antibiotics are used we are becoming resistant to them, As well as being cheaper sugar has another upside as more and more antibiotics are used we are becoming resistant to them, Back in the UK tissue engineering specialist Sheila MacNeil of the University of Sheffeld has researched how naturally occurring sugars can be used to stimulate the re growth of blood vessels Her research stemmed from from her work on tumours when she noticed that one particular small sugar derived from the breakdown of DNA deoxy D ribose kept cropping up MacNeil s team experimented by to the membrane surrounding chick embryos According to MacNeil the sugar stimulated double the number of blood vessels than would grow without it, But of course these types of naturally occurring sugars found in our bodies are a long way from the type of everyday sugar used by Murandu in his experiments The dream ticket MacNeil says would be to find a sugar that could be used in both ways She believes this is the next step research should take, Meanwhile in Wolverhampton Murandu s plan is to set up a private clinic using his sugar method He hopes that one day sugar will be commonly used not only by the NHS but also at public hospitals in some of the other countries where he has been working He continues to get regular emails from around the world asking for his advice and guides patients remotely over email and texting His far away clients send him photos of their results along with their gratitude when they are healed, It is an ancient method and one used unofficially by many poor people in developing countries but for Murandu it was only by coming to the UK that he realised the significance sugar could have in the medical world He sees it as a blending of his local knowledge with the modern research facilities in Britain, Like sugar the knowledge came raw from Zimbabwe was refined here and is now going back to help people in Africa he says, , Follow BBC Future, Explore the BBC]}}

Chelsea Tottenham Dele Alli shows that class is permanent, By Danny Murphy, MOTD pundit and former Tottenham midfielder, Share this with, Dele Alli s performance against Chelsea should act as a reminder for his critics that young footballers can lose a bit of form or miss some chances but they don t lose their quality or class, The technical ability that Alli showed to score his first goal in has always been there even when things were not coming off for him in front of goal, People forget how new he is to this level of football he is still only and that he set the bar really high and very early by coming into the Premier League breaking into the Tottenham team and playing so well, Because he has not been scoring as many goals this season people have been saying he is struggling when he is actually having his best campaign in terms of assists and chances created, That is important because it shows he is still contributing in the final third and is one of the reasons why I have not been worried about his performance levels or jumped on that bandwagon of being negative about him, Alli is someone who plays with such confidence that he is almost arrogant at times he likes his nutmegs and his tricks and they never seem to disappear, I ve watched him a lot and thought that no matter how good his numbers are in terms of his goals he never hides He still gets into dangerous areas, He has not let the criticism he has faced affect his self belief and I always thought the goals would come back if he kept doing the same things, Although he has missed more chances this season he does not seem to suffer from a lack of confidence and that perseverance paid off for him on Sunday, Alli s levels have not dropped because of his diving, When it comes to goals young players numbers generally go up and down a bit anyway and usually far more than Alli s have, But I think there has probably been a little bit too much analysis of his game because of the accusations he has faced of diving They have overshadowed his actual performances sometimes and that is a little bit unfair, Media playback is not supported on this device, Of course there has been some valid criticism of him going down too easily in the box but that should not be enough to make people think that his performance levels have dropped just because he is doing that more, I think there have been a couple of things that have affected Alli s form and that of the whole Tottenham team too, The stadium move did not help especially at the start of the season or the loss of the consistent partnership that Mousa Dembele and Victor Wanyama used to have behind him at the heart of the Spurs midfield, Dembele and Wanyama played a pivotal role in the team s success last season but have started only three league matches together in while Eric Dier another player who Tottenham use in that deeper role has been moved around a lot too, There is also the fact that other teams know how good Alli is now and they set up to try to stop him, On top of that as Spurs have progressed and become a better side the opposition have become more likely to sit back and put numbers behind the ball, It is obviously harder to score goals when that happens but if he is making goals or scoring goals it does not matter because they are equally important, So Alli is on a learning curve as Spurs are as a whole they are a club that has progressed so much more quickly than anyone anticipated and he has been a big part of that from his debut in to his goals on Sunday in his th Premier League appearance, I think there is still so much more to come from him and that he will become even better than he is which is fantastic news for his club and country, Whether Alli starts or not he will make things happen, Alli has got a wonderful relationship with Harry Kane his team mate for Spurs and England, But that s not just because it s Kane Alli could play with anyone because he sees things and tries to make things happen He is also a versatile midfielder, I don t see it as a straight choice between Alli and Jesse Lingard to play in the number role for England at this summer s World Cup finals because if you look at the way Gareth Southgate set up his side in their past two friendlies he used Raheem Sterling there, Although Lingard was also in the team and probably in more of a traditional midfield role he did end up getting forward and into similar areas to Sterling In effect England had two number s instead of one, Alli could play either of those roles and I doubt that right now Southgate will be over thinking which two of that trio he will start with when England begin their campaign in Group G against Tunisia in Volograd on June because it is a good problem for him to have, All three of them have got to be in the squad for Russia but one thing is for sure whether Alli starts or not you can use him at any point and he will get into the opposition area and make something happen, Spurs looking good for another top four finish, Alli did exactly that with his two goals in four second half minutes at Stamford Bridge that gave his side their first win there in the Premier League era, It was a massive result for Tottenham because they now look like they are going to qualify for the Champions League for a third successive year under Mauricio Pochettino before their move to their new stadium, Media playback is not supported on this device, Being in the Champions League is vital for all the big clubs not just for the immediate financial rewards or attracting new players they need it to keep their best players too, If as appears likely Spurs go on to secure another top four finish then Pochettino deserves credit for the way he has improved his players and how they are always so tactically astute and fit and strong, They are going for second place are into the semi finals of the FA Cup and I thought they were desperately unlucky to go out of the Champions League against Juventus so the progression they have made this year is there for all to see, If you judge them on trophies then there is always going to be a question mark until they win one but I think being in the Champions League when they go to their new ground would make this an extremely satisfactory season, Of course in an ideal world they would win the FA Cup too because that would be massive for them more so than for Manchester United or Chelsea in many ways, It looks like Chelsea boss Antonio Conte is going to move on anyway and I don t think winning the FA Cup is going to keep him in his job, United won trophies under Mourinho last season and it feels like they have bigger fish to fry although that will not affect their focus in their semi final against Spurs because the FA Cup is their final chance of more silverware this season too, It would be a much bigger deal for Tottenham to get their first trophy under Pochettino but even if that does not happen there is still plenty for their fans to be positive about because the club is still moving forward, Share this with, Find out more, Top Stories, Related to this story, Football notifications social

hidden workings of babies brains and could prove key in getting earlier support to children who have neurological differences like autism, I am sitting in a lab in London holding my wriggling baby son in my arms while two scientists gently try to remove a futuristic looking cap from his head The cap which looks a bit like a swimming hat topped by a tangle of cables is part of one of the most cutting edge tools in infant research It could reveal unprecedented insights into the minds of babies and transform our understanding of early development, But right now my month old son does not want to be studied, I m sorry baby says Maheen Siddiqui a PhD student here at Birkbeck College s one of the world s leading centres on infant research, Are you ready to unlock Britain s best kept secrets, London and surrounds offer an irresistible cacophony of nightlife food and drink natural wonders and world leading culture for you to check out We ve delved into London and its neighbouring cities of Brighton Bristol Liverpool and Manchester all within approximately hours to unlock their best kept secrets Whether you re in town for a couple of hours a few days or a week allow yourself to be swept up by Britain s allure, , , called functional near infrared spectroscopy or fNIRS to study what happens inside babies brain cells when they look at faces patterns or objects In particular she is looking at an enzyme in the mitochondria the tiny power plants in our cells that generate the energy we need to live The equipment she uses shines near infrared light into the brain light with a specific wavelength that passes through bone and tissue but is absorbed by blood The kit has been specially designed to be comfortable for babies, Unfortunately mine would rather play with the cap than wear it Siddiqui carefully lifts it off Laurel Fish a research assistant blows soap bubbles across the lab My son cheers up I am beginning to understand some of the practical challenges of investigating the earliest weeks and months of human life, How do babies make sense of the world Like many new parents my husband and I asked ourselves this question constantly from the moment our son was born Our infant seemed like a nocturnal little alien mysterious and fascinating He obviously had no idea what clothes were so did he just think we were changing colour all the time And since he had no sense of perspective did he think we changed sizes when we walked across the room, There is a long history of scientists exploring the secret world of babies Darwin for example published a detailed of his baby son when he was days old I happened to sneeze and he started violently for him to develop his theory of evolution But this history is also studded with some extraordinary misunderstandings perhaps because babies cannot tell us what they think and feel In the th and th Centuries many scientists even held the belief that, Modern research on the other hand paints a picture of babies as alert sensitive and intelligent In our first few years more than one million new neural connections Much of this busy brain work is hidden Over the past two decades however technological advances have helped scientists reveal more of it, This is the perfect mix of philosophy and science because you really are asking about things such as the origins of knowledge and how thinking becomes and how learning develops says Natasha Kirkham an expert in child development and researcher at the Babylab I mean these are really kind of big questions, In the early s much of infant research involved tracking the babies eye movements and laboriously analysing the results frame by frame Kirkham says But now it s incredible what we can do The neuroscientific technology has come on in leaps and bounds she tells me There is so much stuff you can do with a baby and learn so much about what they are thinking without them having to tell you, Except of course when they don t feel like cooperating, Having rejected the cap my son is now watching a woman recite nursery rhymes on a screen in front of him clearly more satisfied with this part of the experiment For all his outward calm his brain is now probably tremendously busy especially the area located just behind his ear This patch known as the superior temporal sulcus or STS is part of our social brain It is here that we process our encounters with others, In adults the social brain is well researched But in babies it used to be completely inaccessible, In adults the social brain is well researched But in babies it used to be completely inaccessible Babies simply don t sit still long enough for more conventional instruments such as MRI scanners to work while they are awake, This is where near infrared spectroscopy comes in Siddiqui uses a new type that can measure activity at the cellular level inside the mitochondria There is some evidence that differences in mitochondrial function could be linked to So far the research has consisted of studies of postmortem brain tissue She is hoping to eventually test the hypothesis on live babies, Siddiqui s project is one piece of a vast jigsaw puzzle of knowledge slowly being assembled at the Babylab Researchers are gathering information from MRI scans of sleeping babies sophisticated eye trackers EEGs that measure electrical activity in the brain and even heart rate monitors, One common goal is to understand what typical development looks like and then investigate why and how some babies develop differently This involves studying their minds as well as their environment Kirkham for example is interested in how babies manage to tell important from unimportant information especially in disorganised surroundings, Babies learn by observing the world trying to detect patterns and predict what comes next But this can be difficult if their environment is chaotic or if people around them behave unpredictably, One of the worst things that goes on in a baby s life that can cause endless damage is not being able to predict the reactions of other people Kirkham says That kind of neglect abuse cycle where you don t know what s going to happen when someone comes home or what they re going to do causes the most damage because not being able to predict is frightening, There are too many individual factors involved for Babylab s scientists to give specific parenting advice But their research does allow parents to make more informed decisions and not just because it underlines the importance of loving consistent care For example their research on on babies and toddlers found that their use is associated with less sleep but earlier development of fine motor skills, One tool that has proven particularly integral for these types of findings is near infrared spectroscopy Shining near infrared light through the skull allows researchers to measure levels of blood oxygen in the brain This in turn gives a picture of brain activity since oxygen rich blood flows into active areas, When Babylab research fellow Sarah Lloyd Fox began working with the technology more than a decade ago it already had been used to study adult brains To use it on babies she had to develop it further She now makes the standard headgear a broad black band with attached cables for other labs as well as conducting her own research, I think I m one of the pioneers she says as we sit in the lab s waiting room a cheerful toy strewn space that feels more like a nursery My son seems to have forgotten all about the funny hat He tries to climb onto Lloyd Fox s lap She points out the area behind his ear that is probably being flooded with oxygen rich blood right now his social brain working hard, Babies as young as one day activate their social brain in response to footage of a woman playing peekaboo, Lloyd Fox s research has yielded a series of breakthroughs One of her studies showed that babies as young as one day in response to footage of a woman playing peekaboo Another indicated that the brains of four to six month old babies at risk for autism compared to a low risk group No one had been able to demonstrate this at such a young age before, More generally the technology raises the prospect of the early detection of a whole range of neurological differences helping children get the right support long before the appearance of any outward symptoms, Behaviourally you won t be able to see if this child has autism or has been affected by under nutrition or has had brain injury when they re premature babies potentially until they re two or three years Lloyd Fox says But you can look if there s a brain response prior to that baby being able to respond in a behavioural way, Because the NIRS equipment is cheaper and more mobile than an MRI scanner it also could revolutionise the study of infants in poorer countries, In a clinic in the Gambia contacted the Babylab to ask if they could use NIRS to study local babies Lloyd Fox transported the gear across bumpy roads to a field station where she was able to, The project was not only a first for the Gambia but for all of Africa previously there had not been any infant brain imaging of the kind in the region The collaboration has now grown into a of early development in the Gambia and Britain, One area of focus is the impact of malnutrition as percent of Gambian children are severely undernourished, One of the big questions is how does under nourishment affect the brain says Lloyd Fox Even in adult research they haven t really done this so we re really flying blind in a way in this field We don t really know exactly which brain areas are affected in any person not just infants, At home the Babylab is also undergoing a major expansion The next couple of years will see the opening of a toddler lab complete with a virtual reality cave which promises a completely new perspective on that crucial developmental stage, Much of what parents do instinctively the cooing the cuddling the funny noises has firm scientific backing, Toward the end of my visit to the lab my son falls asleep Today has been another exciting day for him filled with many new impressions I reflect on what the experience has taught me as a parent It has been heartening to hear that babies really do observe us and respond to us long before they can express themselves It is also gratifying to know that much of what parents do instinctively the cooing the cuddling the funny noises has firm scientific backing and provides the best environment for the brain to develop, And as for whether newborns think we change colour and size all the time Kirkham the child development expert said this was a brilliant question Her answer yes it s possible that my son initially thought we changed colour But most likely he simply ignored our clothes and focused on what really mattered to him our faces, , Follow BBC Future, Explore the BBC]}}

url_data=[Accessibility links, BBC navigation, The dangerous downsides of perfectionism, Many of us believe perfectionism is a positive But researchers are finding that it is nothing short of dangerous leading to a long list of health problems and that it s on the rise, In one of my earliest memories I m drawing I don t remember what the picture is supposed to be but I remember the mistake My marker slips an unintentional line appears and my lip trembles The picture has long since disappeared But that feeling of deep frustration even shame stays with me, More often than I d like to admit something seemingly inconsequential will cause the same feeling to rear its head again Something as small as accidentally squashing the panettone I was bringing my boyfriend s family for Christmas can tumble around in my mind for several days accompanied by occasional voices like How stupid and You should have known better Falling short of a bigger goal even when I know achieving it would be near impossible can temporarily flatten me When an agent told me that she knew I was going to write a book someday but that the particular idea I d pitched her didn t suit the market I felt deflated in a gut punching way that went beyond disappointment The negative drowned out the positive You re never going to write a book my internal voice said You re not good enough That voice didn t care that this directly contradicted what the agent actually said, That s the thing about perfectionism It takes no prisoners, , If I ve struggled with perfectionism I m far from alone The tendency starts young and it s becoming more common Thomas Curran and Andrew Hill s recent from to the first study to compare perfectionism across generations found significant increases among more recent undergraduates in the US UK and Canada In other words the average college student last year was much more likely to have perfectionistic tendencies than a student in the s or early s, It s heading toward an epidemic and public health issue Katie Rasmussen, As many as two in five kids and adolescents are perfectionists says Katie Rasmussen who researches child development and perfectionism at West Virginia University We re starting to talk about how it s heading toward an epidemic and public health issue, The rise in perfectionism doesn t mean each generation is becoming more accomplished It means we re getting sicker sadder and even undermining our own potential, Perfectionism after all is an ultimately self defeating way to move through the world It is built on an excruciating irony making and admitting mistakes is a necessary part of growing and learning and being human It also makes you better at your career and relationships and life in general By avoiding mistakes at any cost a perfectionist can make it harder to reach their own lofty goals, But the drawback of perfectionism isn t just that it holds you back from being your most successful productive self Perfectionistic tendencies have been linked to a of clinical issues and even in r and and other and most damning of all even and, There are studies that suggest that the higher the perfectionism is the more psychological disorders you re going to suffer Sarah Egan, It s something that cuts across everything in terms of psychological problems says Sarah Egan a senior research fellow at the Curtin University in Perth who specialises in perfectionism eating disorders and anxiety There aren t that many other things that do that, There are studies that suggest that the higher the perfectionism is the more psychological disorders you re going to suffer, , Culturally we often see perfectionism as a positive Even saying you have perfectionistic tendencies can come off as a coy compliment to yourself it s practically a stock answer to the What s your worst trait question in job interviews Past employers now you know I wasn t just being cute, This is where perfectionism gets complicated and controversial Some researchers say there is adaptive or healthy perfectionism characterised by having high standards motivation and discipline versus a maladaptive or unhealthy version when your best never seems good enough and not meeting goals frustrates you In one of more than Chinese students researchers found that gifted students were more perfectionistic in the adaptive ways Maladaptive perfectionists on the other hand were more likely to be non gifted And while research shows that maladaptive attributes like or feeling like you make you more vulnerable to depression some other studies have shown that adaptive aspects like striving for achievement at all or, But that isn t always the case for example And even if there sometimes may be upsides to perfectionist thinking they are minor and researchers argue misunderstood, In a of studies on perfectionism and burnout for example Hill and Curran found that athletes employees and students experienced either a tiny or no benefit from aspects like having very high personal standards compared to people who didn t have them People who expressed more maladaptive perfectionism on the other hand experienced significantly more burnout, Perfectionism isn t a behaviour It s a way of thinking about yourself Andrew Hill, There has been some suggestion that in some cases perfectionism might be healthy and desirable Based upon the odd studies that we ve done we think that s a misunderstanding says York St John University s Hill Working hard being committed diligent and so on these are all desirable features But for a perfectionist those are really a symptom or a side product of what perfectionism is Perfectionism isn t about high standards It s about unrealistic standards, Perfectionism isn t a behaviour It s a way of thinking about yourself, In fact many researchers say that factors often dubbed healthy perfectionism like striving for excellence at all They re just conscientiousness which explains why people with those tendencies often have different outcomes in studies Perfectionism they argue isn t defined by working hard or setting high goals It s that critical inner voice, Take the student who works hard and gets a poor mark If she tells herself I m disappointed but it s okay I m still a good person overall that s healthy If the message is I m a failure I m not good enough that s perfectionism, That inner voice criticises different things for different people work relationships tidiness fitness My own tendencies may differ greatly from somebody else s It can take someone who knows me well to pick up on them When I messaged my partner I was writing this story he immediately sent back a long line of laughing emojis, Perfectionists feel every bump in the road They re quite stress sensitive Hill, As a result perfectionists and non perfectionists might look the same for a short period of time from a distance But when you get up close and observe them over time conscientious people have more adaptive ways of coping with things when things go wrong Hill says Perfectionists feel every bump in the road They re quite stress sensitive, Perfectionists can make smooth sailing into a storm a brief ill wind into a category five hurricane At the very least And because the ironies never end the behaviours perfectionists adapt ultimately actually do make them more likely to fail, In one lab experiment for example Hill gave both perfectionists and non perfectionists specific goals What he didn t tell them was that the test was rigged none of them would succeed Interestingly both groups kept putting in the same amount of effort But one group felt much unhappier about the whole thing and gave up earlier Guess which, Faced with failure perfectionists tend to respond more harshly in terms of emotions They experience more guilt more shame says Hill They also experience, They give up more easily They have quite avoidant coping tendencies when things can t be perfect, That of course hinders them from the very success that they want to achieve In his plus studies focusing on athletes for example Hill has found that the single biggest predictor of success in sports is simply practice But if practice isn t going well perfectionists might stop, It makes me think of my own childhood peppered with avoiding or starting and quitting almost every sport there was If I wasn t adept at something almost from the get go I didn t want to continue especially if there was an audience watching In fact multiple studies have found a correlation between perfectionism and performance anxiety, The trouble is that for perfectionists performance is intertwined with their sense of self When they don t succeed they don t just feel disappointment about how they did They feel shame about who they are Ironically perfectionism then becomes a defence tactic to keep shame at bay if you re perfect you never fail and if you never fail there s no shame, As a result the pursuit of perfection becomes a vicious cycle and because it s impossible to be perfect a fruitless one, , Perfectionism is also dangerous Record numbers of young people are experiencing mental illness according to the World Health Organisation Depression anxiety and suicide ideation are more common in the US Canada and the UK now than a decade ago Research shows that perfectionistic tendencies predict issues like and even when researchers controlled for traits like neuroticism Worsening matters being self critical might lead to depressive symptoms but closing a distressing loop, Mental health problems aren t just caused by perfectionism some of these problems can lead to perfectionism too for example found that over a one year period college students who had social anxiety were more likely to become perfectionists but not vice versa, It s also been shown that against anxiety and depression is self compassion the very thing that perfectionists lack And self criticism which perfectionists are so good at, Nearly every perfectionistic tendency including simply having high personal standards was correlated with thinking about suicide more frequently, When it comes to the most dramatic example suicide also have found that perfectionism is a lethal contributor all on its own One found that even above and beyond feelings of hopelessness A recent the most complete on the suicide perfectionism link to date found that nearly every perfectionistic tendency including being concerned over mistakes feeling like you are never good enough having critical parents or simply having high personal standards was correlated with thinking about suicide more frequently The two exceptions being organised or demanding of others, Some of those criteria particularly pressure from parents and perfectionistic concerns also were correlated with more suicide attempts, Black and white thinking can lead perfectionists to interpret failures as catastrophes that in extreme circumstances are seen as warranting death the researchers wrote Our findings also join a wider literature suggesting that when people experience their social world as pressure filled judgmental and hypercritical they think about and or engage in various potential means of escape eg alcohol misuse and binge eating including suicide, And while conscientious people tend to live longer, In many ways poorer health outcomes for perfectionists aren t that surprising Perfectionists are pretty much awash with stress Even when it s not stressful they ll typically find a way to make it stressful says Gordon Flett who has studied perfectionism for more than years and whose developed with Paul Hewitt is considered a gold standard, Plus he says if your perfectionism finds an outlet in say workaholism it s unlikely you ll take many breaks to relax which we now know both, , No matter how self defeating perfectionism may seem it s a tendency being shared by more and more people The is the first to comprehensively look at rates of perfectionism over a long period of time There are so many ways of measuring perfectionism out there researchers had to wait until a solid one in this case Flett s and Hewitt s had been around long enough and been used across enough studies In all the studies added up to a pool of more than US UK and Canadian undergraduate students, There were increases in every type of perfectionism from to, There were increases across the board from to But the largest rise was in socially prescribed perfectionism characterised by the feeling that others have high demands The reason that s so problematic is that s the dimension most strongly correlated with serious mental illness says Curran, The findings align with what s been reported previously One of gifted suburban adolescents for example found significantly higher scores of perfectionism especially unhealthy dimensions than previous studies found the same, In her clinical practice where she often works with patients with eating disorders Egan has seen it too I m constantly shocked by the age ranges We re seeing younger and younger presentations of girls seven years old eight years old she says That s often driven by perfectionism So I think yes each generation probably is getting more perfectionistic, Where is this increase coming from When you keep in mind the idea that perfectionism stems from marrying your identity with your achievements the question might become where isn t it coming from, After all many of us live in societies where the first question when you meet someone is what you do for a living Where we are so literally valued for the quality and extent of our accomplishments that those achievements often correlate directly to our ability to pay rent or put food on the table Where complete strangers weigh these on paper values to determine everything from whether we can rent that flat or buy that car or receive that loan Where we then signal our access to those resources with our appearance these shoes that physique and other people weigh that in turn to see if we re the right person for a job interview or dinner invitation, Curran and Hill have a similar hunch Failure is so severe in a market based society points out Curran adding that that has been intensified as at Competition even has been embedded in schools take standardised testing and high pressure university entrances As a result Curran says it s no wonder that parents are putting more pressure on themselves and on their children to achieve more and more, If the focus is on achievement then kids become very averse to mistakes Curran says If children come to internalise that the idea that we only can define ourselves in strict narrow terms of achievement then you see perfectionistic tendencies start to come in for example found that a focus on academic achievement predicts a later increase in perfectionism, Similarly the gold star method of parenting and schooling may have had an effect If you get praised whenever you do something well and not praised when you don t you can learn that you re only really worth something when you ve had others approval, If the focus is on achievement then kids become very averse to mistakes Thomas Curran, If other strategies like making children feel guilty for making a mistake come in it can get even more problematic Research has found that and later to develop depression, Fear of failure is getting magnified in other ways too Take social media make a mistake today and your fear that it might be broadcast even globally is hardly irrational At the same time all of those glossy feeds reinforce unrealistic standards, But it also arises because of environment after all if it were just genetic it seems unlikely it would be increasing so much So how can parents counteract it Model good behaviour by watching their own perfectionistic tendencies researchers say And exhibit unconditional love and affection, It s about creating an environment where imperfection isn t just accepted but is celebrated because it means we re human Rasmussen, It s saying things like You really tried hard at that I m proud of the effort you put in It s about creating an environment where imperfection isn t just accepted but is celebrated because it means we re human says Rasmussen who co authored an on how family systems can breed perfectionism Or communicating to the child that love and care aren t conditional on performance, It s the idea that you don t have to be perfect to be lovable or to be loved, , Perfectionism can be a particular challenge to treat You can train someone to be more self compassionate in a therapeutic setting But if they go back to the office say with the same demanding boss and same deep seated behaviours a lot of that can go out the door, Then of course there is that widespread if erroneous belief that being a perfectionist makes us better workers or parents or athletes or whatever the task is at hand, What makes it different than depression or anxiety is that the person often values it Egan, The difficult part of it and what makes it different than depression or anxiety is that the person often values it says Egan If we have anxiety or depression we don t value those symptoms We want to get rid of them When we see a person with perfectionism they can often be ambivalent towards change People say it brings them benefits, She s helped her patients by helping them prove to themselves that s not the case If someone says for example they need to do three extra hours of work at home each night to be good at their job they might experiment with not doing that for a week Usually the patient not only finds that it makes no difference but that the extra rest might even improve their performance, I ve experimented with some of that letting go myself It s gone hand in hand with becoming aware when I m taking on too much and exhausting myself in my attempt to do enough an amount I ve realised that for me doesn t actually exist, The bigger piece though is replacing that critical ticker tape with kinder messages toward both myself and others I ve started with varying success consciously stopping myself from overreacting to other people s mistakes More difficult but also important has been stopping myself from overreacting to my own Ironically that includes trying not to criticise myself when I fall short of that goal in itself, It s a work in progress But what I ve noticed is that each time I m able to replace criticising and perfecting with compassion I feel not only less stressed but freer Apparently that s not unusual, It can be liberating allowing imperfection to happen and accepting it and celebrating it Rasmussen says Because it s exhausting maintaining all of that, Follow BBC Future, Explore the BBC]}}

with, Ian Poulter s most timely victory in Houston put the perfect exclamation mark on an extraordinary build up to this week s Masters, Rarely has there been more excitement before the journey that takes the world s top golfers down Magnolia Lane to the verdant yet capricious pastures of the Augusta National, Week after week has generated a captivating storyline this year particularly when viewed through the prism of the first men s major of the year On Sunday in Texas Poulter was entirely in keeping, This was especially the case considering his dramatic backstory The passionate Englishman thought his Augusta chances had been dashed with quarter final defeat at the WGC Match Play which left him st in the world and one place away from Masters qualification, Yet the man they love to call the postman delivered in spectacular style to make the sudden death play off against Beau Hossler, Poulter held his nerve at the first extra hole and suddenly it was next stop Augusta where he joins a field of in form golfing thoroughbreds hell bent on getting the job done to secure a landmark major win, Take your pick from Rory McIlroy seeking to complete the career grand slam Tiger Woods contending for a th major Phil Mickelson trying to become the oldest Masters winner or Bubba Watson vying for a third Green Jacket, All four have put together bodies of work this season that justify their claims to be considered among the favourites, There was McIlroy s three weeks ago Woods in collecting two top five finishes in four starts the year old and Watson collected at the WGC Match Play, But then consider the claims of world number two Justin Thomas The United States player of the year in and has not been out of the top four in his past three events, After a largely indifferent start to the year Jordan Spieth is suddenly trending nicely The Open champion finished third in Houston a decent fillip as he heads to the scene of his first major triumph back in, Spieth s Masters record second first second and th mark out the year old American as an Augusta specialist, Yet years on from Scot Sandy Lyle becoming the first British winner of a Green Jacket the portents for more UK success could hardly be more encouraging Poulter s win was the third UK triumph in the past four weeks on the PGA Tour, Northern Irishman McIlroy was the victor at Bay Hill a week after England s Paul Casey ended a long winless spell by at the Valspar Championship also in Florida, With that hurdle overcome might this be the week for the year old to make his major breakthrough His long game and the current sureness of putting touch are made for the Masters, Everyone s focused on Tiger, Were Casey to triumph it would come amid the unique buzz that Woods brings to any event he plays and its volume is turned up to the max when that tournament is the Masters, I think everyone s kind of solely focused on Tiger and what he s going to do here and seeing if he can get to number said Jason Day Woods great friend and a former world number one, Obviously his driving s not the greatest but once he s on the fairway he hits unbelievable iron shots And if he doesn t then everyone likes seeing the big flop shot and he holes those big long putts and makes things exciting, But with Woods commanding so much attention there could be scope for the other big names to go about their business relatively undisturbed, That s fine with us added Day I can just kind of focus on what I need to do to try and win this tournament, World number one Dustin Johnson will likely feel the same as he tries to make up for last year s dramatic withdrawal through injury having headed into Masters week as the clear favourite, Despite winning early in the year in Hawaii Johnson has struggled to find his best form in recent weeks The frustration of his agonising tumble down the stairs on the eve of the tournament though provides the kind of storyline that would be in keeping with this year s compelling narrative, The same can be said of England s Justin Rose an Augusta specialist with two runner up finishes in the past three Masters including last year s play off defeat by Sergio Garcia, Rose has three top eight finishes in his past five events and has been quietly targeting this week all year, And what about the prospects of a successful title defence for charismatic Spaniard Garcia within weeks of becoming a dad and naming his daughter Azalea in honour of last year s maiden major win, The storylines come thick and fast with plenty of room for UK optimism Tyrrell Hatton has a putting touch made for Augusta s treacherous greens while Tommy Fleetwood s unflappable nature is an invaluable asset at this major, Who is going to win You choose but with so many outstanding candidates it seems certain to be one of the most memorable of Masters, Indeed this is the perfect venue for BBC Sport to launch its new golf podcast The Cut which will be available to download from

people become sudden geniuses, There s mounting evidence that brain damage has the power to unlock extraordinary creative talents What can this teach us about how geniuses are made, It was the summer of and Eadweard Muybridge was running low on books This was somewhat problematic since he was a bookseller He handed his San Francisco shop over to his brother and set off on a stagecoach to buy supplies Little did he know he was about to change the world forever, He was some way into his journey in north eastern Texas when the coach ran into trouble The driver cracked his whip and the horses broke into a run leading the coach surging down a steep mountain road Eventually it veered off and into a tree Muybridge was catapulted into the air and cracked his head on a boulder, He woke up nine days later at a hospital miles km away The accident left him with a panoply of medical problems including double vision bouts of seizures and no sense of smell hearing or taste But the most radical change was his personality, Previously Muybridge had been a genial and open man with good business sense Afterwards he was risk taking eccentric and moody he later murdered his wife s lover He was also quite possibly a genius, The question of where creative insights come from and how to get more of them has remained a subject of great speculation for thousands of years According to scientists they can be driven by anything from to The prodigies themselves have other even less convincing ideas Plato said that they were the result of divine madness Or do they as Freud believed arise from the that eureka moments are born out of cool headwork and technical knowledge, But until recently most sensible people agreed on one thing creativity begins in the pink wobbly mass inside our skulls It surely goes without saying that striking the brain impaling it electrocuting it shooting it slicing bits out of it or depriving it of oxygen would lead to the swift death of any great visions possessed by its owner, As it happens sometimes the opposite is true, After the accident Muybridge eventually recovered enough to sail to England There his creativity really took hold He abandoned bookselling and became a photographer one of the most famous in the world He was also a prolific inventor Before the accident he hadn t filed a single patent In the following two decades he applied for at least, In he took a bet that allowed him to combine invention and photography Legend has it that his friend a wealthy railroad tycoon called Leland Stanford was convinced that horses could fly Or more accurately he was convinced that when they run all their legs leave the ground at the same time Muybridge said they didn t, To prove it he placed cameras along a horse track and installed a tripwire that would set them off automatically as Stanford s favourite racing horse Occident ran Next he invented the inelegantly named zoopraxiscope a device which allowed him to project several images in quick succession and give the impression of motion To his amazement the horse was briefly suspended mid gallop Muybridge had filmed the first movie and with it proven that yes horses can fly, Jon Sarkin was transformed from a chiropractor into an artist after a stroke, The abrupt turnaround of Muybridge s life from ordinary bookseller to creative genius has It s possible that he had sudden savant syndrome in which exceptional abilities emerge after a brain injury or disease It s extremely rare with just verified cases on the planet, There s Tony Cicoria an orthopaedic surgeon who was struck by lightning at a New York park in It went straight through his head and left him with an irresistible desire to play the piano To begin with he was playing other people s music but soon he started writing down the melodies that were constantly running through his head Today he s a pianist and composer as well as a practicing surgeon, Another case is Jon Sarkin who was transformed from a chiropractor into an artist after a stroke The urge to draw landed almost immediately He was having all kinds of therapy at the hospital speech therapy art therapy physical therapy occupational therapy mental therapy And they stuck a crayon in my hand and said want to draw And I said fine he says, His first muse was a cactus at his home in Gloucester Massachusetts It was the fingered kind like you might find in Western movies from the s Even his In some versions the branches resemble swirling green snakes while others they are red zig zagging staircases, His works have since been published in The New York Times featured on album covers and been covered in a book by a Pulitzer Prize winning author They regularly sell for, Most strikingly there s Jason Padgett who was attacked at a bar in Tacoma Washington in Before the attack Padgett was a college dropout who worked at a futon store His primary passions in life were partying and chasing girls He had no interest in maths at school he didn t even get into algebra class, But that night everything changed Initially he was taken to the hospital with a severe concussion I remember thinking that everything looked funky but I thought it was just the narcotic pain shot they gave me he says Then the next morning I woke up and turned on the water It looked like little tangent lines a straight line that touches a single point on a curve spiralling down, When you re bashed on the head the effects are similar to a dose of LSD, From then onwards Padgett s world was overlaid with geometric shapes and gridlines He became obsessed with maths and is now renowned for his drawings of formulas such as Pi Today he s incredulous that he once didn t know what a tangent was I do feel like two people and I ve had my mum and my dad say that It s like having two separate kids he says, Why does this happen How does it work And what does it teach us about what makes geniuses special, There are two leading ideas The first is that when you re bashed on the head the effects are similar to a dose of LSD Psychedelic drugs are thought to enhance creativity by increasing the levels of serotonin the so called happiness hormone in the brain This leads to synaesthesia in which more than one region is simultaneously activated and senses which are usually separate become linked, Many people don t need drugs to experience this nearly of the population has some form of synaesthesia with the most common type being grapheme colour in which words are associated with colours For example the that Mondays are pale blue, When the brain is injured dead and dying cells leak serotonin into the surrounding tissue Physically this seems to encourage new connections between brain regions just as with LSD Mentally it allows the person to link the seemingly unconnected We ve found permanent changes before you can actually see connections in the brain that weren t there before says Berit Brogaard a neuroscientist who directs the Brogaard Lab for Multisensory Research Florida, But there is an alternative The first clue emerged in when a group of neurologists noticed that five of their patients with dementia were also artists remarkably good ones Specifically they had which is unusual in that it only affects some parts of the brain For example visual creativity may be spared while language and social skills are progressively destroyed, One of these was Patient At the age of he had enrolled in a short course in drawing at a local park though he previously had no interest in such things It just so happened to coincide with the onset of his dementia a few months later he was having trouble speaking, Soon he became irritable and eccentric developing a compulsion to search for money on the street As his illness progressed so did his drawing advancing from simple still life paintings to haunting impressionist depictions of buildings from his childhood, To find out what was going on the scientists performed D scans of their patients brains In four out of five cases they found lesions on the left hemisphere Nobel Prize winning research from the s shows that the two halves of the brain specialise in different tasks in general the right side is home to creativity and the left is the centre of logic and language, Autistic savants can have superhuman skills to rival those of the Renaissance polymaths, But the left side is also something of a bully It tends to be the dominant brain region says Brogaard It tends to suppress very marginal types of thinking highly original highly creative thinking because it s beneficial for our decision making abilities and our ability to function in normal life The theory goes that as the patients left hemispheres became progressively more damaged their right hemispheres were free to flourish, This is backed up by several other studies including one in which in healthy volunteers by temporarily dialling down activity in the left hemisphere and increasing it in the right the lead researcher Allen Snyder s work was replicated by another person so that s the theory that I think is responsible says Darold Treffert a psychiatrist from the University of Wisconsin Medical School who has been studying savant syndrome for decades, But what about more mainstream geniuses Could the theory explain their talents too, Consider autism From Daniel Tammet who can perform mind boggling mathematical calculations at stupendous speed to Gottfried Mind the Cat Raphael who drew the animal with an astonishing level of realism so called autistic savants can have superhuman skills to rival those of the Renaissance polymaths, It s been estimated that as many as one in people with autism have savant syndrome and there s mounting evidence the disorder is And though it s difficult to prove it s been speculated that numerous intellectual giants including Einstein Newton Mozart Darwin and Michelangelo were on the spectrum, One theory suggests that autism arises from abnormally low levels of serotonin in the left hemisphere in childhood which prevents the region from developing normally Just like with sudden savant syndrome this allows the right hemisphere to become more active, They are usually able to have a normal life but they also have this obsession Berit Brogaard neuroscientist, Interestingly many people with sudden savant syndrome also develop symptoms of autism including social problems obsessive compulsive disorder OCD and all consuming interests It got so bad that if I had money I would spray the money with Lysol and put it in the microwave for a few seconds to get rid of the germs says Padgett, They are usually able to have a normal life but they also have this obsession says Brogaard This is something universal across all sudden savants Jon Sarkin compares his art to an instinct It doesn t feel like I like drawing it feels like I must draw His studio contains thousands of finished and unfinished works which are often scribbled with curves words cross hatchings and overlapping images, In fact though they often don t need to sudden savants work hard at improving their craft I mean I practiced a lot Talent and hard work I think they are indistinguishable you do something a lot and you get better at it says Sarkin Padgett agrees When you re fixated on something like that of course you do discover things, Muybridge was no exception After the bet he moved to Philadelphia and continued with his passion for capturing motion on film photographing all kinds of activities such as walking up and down the stairs and oddly himself swinging a pickaxe in the nude Between and he took more than pictures, In my opinion at least the fact that they can improve their abilities doesn t negate the suddenness or insistence with which they are there says Treffert As our understanding of sudden savant syndrome improves eventually it s hoped that we might all be able to unlock our hidden mental powers perhaps with the help of smart drugs or hardware, But until then perhaps us mortals could try putting in some extra hours instead, , , Follow BBC Future, Explore the BBC]}}

wins this weekend for Liverpool for whom Mohamed Salah scored his th league goal of the season Leicester Manchester United Newcastle Burnley West Ham Manchester City Arsenal and Tottenham, But who has impressed me most Here is my team for this week, Goalkeeper David de Gea Manchester United, I saw one slip through his fingers in midweek against Argentina but that didn t affect David de Gea one bit Against Swansea the Spain international was back to his best Two saves from Tammy Abraham before which De Gea had had nothing to do were absolutely magnificent, The first save De Gea made from the Swansea striker suggested his hand was made of bronze such was the strength in his wrist The second save was equally impressive as he had to read the pitch of the ball before it reared up violently towards goal How he kept the ball from entering the net I will never know United are winning matches under Jose Mourinho but still not looking great, De Gea made two important saves as he kept his th Premier League clean sheet of the season two more clean sheets than any other keeper, Defence Davinson Sanchez Tottenham Jan Vertonghen Tottenham Vincent Kompany Manchester City, Not withstanding the mistake by Hugo Lloris for the first goal I thought Spurs played brilliantly at the back The performance by Davinson Sanchez was particularly impressive as I have seen him struggle on these big occasions before, However he seems to have come to terms with playing in hostile environments while retaining a level of composure Meanwhile Chelsea look like an unhappy camp and manager Antonio Conte looks the unhappiest of all, Sanchez made clearances in Tottenham s win over Chelsea four more than any other player, I thought Jan Vertonghen was immense for Tottenham against Chelsea Once Spurs had recovered from that horrendous mistake by Lloris I don t think Alvaro Morata had a kick and Eden Hazard slowly went AWOL, Meanwhile Conte refused to answer questions about why Chelsea have found it so difficult to win back to back titles I can offer a simple suggestion Have they simply run out of money, Vertonghen made five interceptions against Chelsea No Tottenham player made more in the match, At Everton Vincent Kompany came through another fixture unscathed rather like his team Manchester City So the scene is set for the champions elect to actually lift the title For that game to be against their arch rivals Manchester United is something more in keeping with a Hollywood blockbuster than a Premier League fixture in April, It would be quite wrong if the player who has steered City into becoming serious Champions League contenders over the years was not present to lift the title And lift it they will, Kompany made five clearances in City s win over Everton two more than any other City player, Midfield Jesse Lingard Manchester United Christian Eriksen Tottenham David Silva Manchester City Dele Alli Tottenham, This lad has to be in England s starting XI for the World Cup on current form Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has tried to use Lingard sparingly this season but failed All credit to this young player he has not only bulldozed his way into United s starting line up but he s currently running the show, Lingard was involved in all of United s goals against Swansea while displaying a range of passes in his repertoire Could Gareth Southgate play both Lingard and Dele Alli in the same England team Or is it too much like Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard Nice thought though, Lingard put in an all round performance with no United player having more shots four or making more tackles three than the England international, The only way this player s season can get any better is if he can add a trophy to it Eriksen has been in amazing form and he is capping these performances with sensational goals, His strike against Chelsea was amazing and the shot flew past Willy Caballero from all of yards Spurs have waited years to win at Stamford Bridge and it wouldn t have happened without Eriksen, Eriksen has scored goals from outside the penalty area since his Premier League debut in September the most of any current player in that time in the competition, Manchester City have only been beaten once in their past matches Having watched their first half display against Everton I am not surprised At the heart of this City walkover was David Silva, If he wasn t forcing Jordan Pickford to scramble across his goalmouth in a desperate attempt to alleviate the danger he was threading the ball through the eye of a needle for one of his team mates to exploit Another amazing season by the Spaniard, Only Eden Hazard six created more from open play in the Premier League over the weekend than Silva five with two of those turning into assists for goals, Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino went to some length in his media conference to extol the virtues of Dele Alli I spent the first hour of the match against Chelsea bemoaning his lack of contribution to the game and then spent the rest of the game choking on my words, Make no mistake Alli has struggled this season but his manager has shown great faith in this player and the talent has responded With Alli coming back to form and Harry Kane back from injury Spurs suddenly look a force again, Alli marked his th Premier League game with his first top flight double since January, Forwards Sadio Mane Liverpool Marko Arnautovic West Ham Leroy Sane Manchester City, For an hour Sadio Mane terrified Crystal Palace But how Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp had the brass neck to even suggest the striker deserved a penalty after James McArthur appeared to make contact in the box I have no idea, How many more times do I have to say this Contact in the box doesn t automatically mean it s a penalty A foul does The delay between the contact being made by McArthur and Mane going to ground was clearly evident and destroyed whatever claim Liverpool could have made, Referee Neil Swarbrick then gave Mane the benefit of the doubt by not issuing a second yellow card for Mane grabbing the ball And Klopp had the temerity to criticise the referee in his post match interview for not awarding Liverpool a penalty, Mane was lucky to be on the pitch at all As for Klopp he should just have said thank you and gone on his way, Mane s goal at Palace made him the joint highest scoring Senegalese player in Premier League history equalling Demba Ba s record of in the competition, Regular readers of my team of the week will know that I warned Mark Hughes when he was manager of Stoke that his criticism of Marko Arnautovic on his return to the Bet Stadium earlier in the season was ill advised, Strikers stay awake at night desperate to stick two fingers up to managers who publicly criticise them The Austrian international exercised his right to inflict another blow to Hughes long term career prospects this time against Southampton with an awesome display of finishing, How ironic Arnautovic could have a say in both Southampton and Stoke going down Where that would leave Mark Hughes is anyone s guess, Arnautovic has been directly involved in more Premier League goals this season than any other West Ham player nine goals three assists, I saw this lad play in midweek when he led Germany s line against Brazil He was hot in the international friendly but he was mustard for Manchester City against Everton, It only took Sane four minutes to get off the mark And what a volley it was too Technically brilliant His assist wasn t bad either He flicked the ball over a floundering Phil Jagielka in the middle of the park and then proceeded to do the same to Leighton Baines, He then dispatched the ball to Gabriel Jesus via Kevin de Bruyne to head the ball into the back of the net Sheer class, After scoring City s opening goal Sane created four chances against Everton, Pick your Team of the Week, Pick your XI from our list and share with your friends, The Crooks of the matter, To say I m astonished that not a single British referee will be on show during the World Cup is an understatement It s the first time since that such a decision has been made, Fifa has chosen international referees and assistants from around the world and not one from these shores It would appear on the face of things that our match officials like our coaches don t export very well these days, Yet it s not that long ago that both were the envy of the world our referees for the quality of their decision making and our coaches for their sheer professionalism, No longer it would seem, How much of this cold shoulder can be attributed to the envy of the Premier League or the FA s fall outs with Fifa over the World Cup bidding process is hard to tell, However what is glaringly obvious to me is that Fifa wants referees who work very hard to keep all the players on the pitch, Why Because it makes for a better spectacle Two of our most capable referees Howard Webb and Mark Clattenburg were leading exponents of this noble art and that is probably why they were the last two Brits to officiate at the World Cup and European Championship respectively, The second yellow card given to Leicester s Wilfred Ndidi by referee Chris Kavanagh in the Foxes win at Brighton is exactly what Fifa does not want to see Referees should take no pleasure in sending players off After all it is the players who the public have paid to see, But I get the distinct feeling that referees in the Premier League in their desperation to eliminate the assassins in the game are prepared to take some of the artists with them if necessary and that has served to ruin the occasion, Fifa cannot afford too many party poopers in Russia and that is probably why British referees have not been invited,

meteorologists risked their lives to collect weather readings from Scotland s Ben Nevis Today their sacrifices are helping us understand the effects of climate change, Each year people hike Scotland s Ben Nevis a former volcano and Britain s highest mountain at m ft above sea level Many opt to take the so called tourist trail the rocky path which winds and zigzags its way to the summit Few realise that this path was initially carved out in for a very unique scientific expedition Even fewer know that now more than a century later this site is providing UK scientists with insights into climate change, Back in Victorian Britain science was still largely an amateur pastime conducted by bands of self financed enthusiasts who formed scientific societies One was the Scottish Meteorological Society which set up and maintained a network of weather stations across Scotland between and, Are you ready to unlock Britain s best kept secrets, London and surrounds offer an irresistible cacophony of nightlife food and drink natural wonders and world leading culture for you to check out We ve delved into London and its neighbouring cities of Brighton Bristol Liverpool and Manchester all within approximately hours to unlock their best kept secrets Whether you re in town for a couple of hours a few days or a week allow yourself to be swept up by Britain s allure, , At the time a key question was how depressions storms and other severe climatic events form in the atmosphere By mountain observatories were being established across the US Mexico India France Germany and Russia, , Keen to gather similar data for Britain the Scottish Meteorological Society decided to build a weather station at the top of Ben Nevis For a trial run one particularly intrepid member scaled the mountain every day for four months through blizzards gales and heavy storms to record measurements at the summit Funding to build the station and obtain the instruments was raised through a kind of th Century crowdfunding initiative Even Queen Victoria donated, And so began a remarkable experiment in Victorian stoicism and scientific endeavour From to a few hardy individuals lived year round in a small stone hut surviving on tinned food and making hourly recordings of everything from atmospheric temperature to humidity wind speed to rainfall In total they made almost million observations often going to extraordinary lengths and risking their lives to record data in the most hostile of conditions, Many of their scientific contemporaries were involved in planning Arctic or Antarctic expeditions but these guys were pioneering explorers of the atmosphere says Ed Hawkins professor of climate science at the University of Reading, They were living in very severe weather conditions mph winds were not uncommon the temperature would drop to C F at times and they lived inside a cloud for most of the year But on the rare occasions the cloud was below them they got the most amazing views So I suspect they lived for those days where they could see for miles and miles around, The harsh realities of life at the top of a mountain quickly became apparent during the first winter of With heavy blizzards leaving the entire summit covered in a ft m layer of snow the three weathermen found themselves snowed in to such an extent that they had to repeatedly dig tunnels just to get out, They were very committed to try and take these measurements every hour working in four to eight hour shifts throughout day and night But very occasionally they were beaten by the weather Hawkins says, Rather than being thwarted by their extreme living environment the weathermen developed ingenious solutions like building a wooden tower which allowed them to crawl out onto the roof of the observatory tethered to a rope to take instrument readings in adverse weather Occasionally they even resorted to using their own bodies to lean into the wind in order to calibrate estimates of wind speed an activity which sometimes saw them almost blown off the mountain, The main danger they faced was that they were very close to the edge of the cliff says Marjory Roy who wrote the book The Weathermen of Ben Nevis The summit is a longish ride just ft m wide with a sheer drop on the north side of ft m, They also used to take measurements at a place high on the mountain known as the plateau of storms and the path there was fairly narrow If you weren t careful you would disappear off the cliff completely, Blizzards and precarious mountain paths were far from the only scares the weathermen faced On a couple of occasions the observatory was struck by lightning The first time the lightning came down the chimney and set the wooden lining of the building on fire The blaze was extinguished, During the summer and autumn months when life was a little less arduous the observatory attracted a number of volunteers mostly students One was Charles Wilson who was inspired to study clouds by his experience at the top of the mountain He later won the Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of the cloud chamber the first device to make it possible to detect radiation and subatomic particles which we cannot see with the naked eye, Wilson was only there for two weeks but during that time he got the most brilliant period of anticyclonic conditions and glorious views Roy says It was those things which inspired people There were a number of people whose experiences up there influenced them to go on and discover things which made them famous, By the Scottish Meteorological Society could no longer afford the observatory s running costs It was closed down and the data largely has remained hidden in the dusty pages of archives ever since, Today we have advanced weather forecast models which are capable of using the kind of data taken at Ben Nevis to generate three dimensional pictures of the atmosphere Climate scientists now hope to use these models to re observe famously severe storms from more than a century ago such as a storm which wreaked havoc in Ireland before passing right over the top of Ben Nevis the following day, The first step in a project which Hawkins is leading is to compare the historical data from Ben Nevis to modern weather readings, We live in a part of the world which gets storms and we ll always have them But we re trying to understand whether these storms are becoming more or less frequent are they becoming more severe are we getting more rain out of these storms are they changing direction Hawkins says Going back in time and looking at the storms of that period enables us to compare with the storms of today and look at the potential changes which have resulted from human driven warming of the atmosphere over the past century, But these goals met a slight setback Feeding the original Ben Nevis weather data into a computer model requires all the observations to be digitised While the thousands of pages of observations were published in scientific journals in the early th Century and have been subsequently scanned typing all million into an online database would take years, And so thousands of volunteers across Europe have helped digitise the observations over a period of just weeks in autumn, As a result Hawkins team is now looking at how the amount of moisture in today s storms compares to those in the late th Century A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and so when it rains in a storm today we expect the amount of rain to be much greater compared to a storm a century ago of the same severity he says It s a fingerprint of how things are changing in a warmer world, Today plans are underfoot to build a new modern observatory on the ruins on the former site albeit with automatic measuring devices rather than human inhabitants We haven t had any long term observations up there for a long time now and this would give us information straight away on how the climate at the top of the mountain has changed Hawkins says We think that the high altitude regions are some of the places where we ve seen the largest changes in temperature, This could tell us a lot, , Follow BBC Future, Explore the BBC]}}

football kit for every day of the week, Options to share this content, It s a familiar football gripe a firm favourite among those the game s gone types that football clubs have too many kits, Home kits away kits third kits European kits it s all gone a bit silly What happened to the good old days when teams wore two designs at most the famed and historic hue of their home shirt and mud, But despite the plethora of merch available in modern football not many clubs can boast wearing different kits throughout the course of a single season but German side FC Cologne have achieved the rather bizarre feat, You may be familiar with Cologne s work After all they are former Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski s favourite team and their when they popped over to London for a Europa League match against the Gunners earlier in the season, But after finishing fifth in the league last year the Billy Goats are rock bottom of the Bundesliga table, It s been a torrid season on the pitch but off it the club s kit manufacturer has been kept busy churning out kit after kit, Here are the seven that the German side have worn since the beginning of the season, The red and white one, This red and white striped kit seen here worn by Milos Jojic is Cologne s official home kit That s usually the strip that football clubs wear throughout the majority of the season but obviously that hasn t quite been the case for Cologne, The red one, It s fair to say Cologne haven t switched things up massively for their away shirt It s also red, They wore this one for their Bundesliga defeat against Stuttgart in October when they conceded a last minute winner to lose Perhaps it was time to try out another kit Ok then, The grey and yellow one, Next up is the team s third kit which features a grey and neon yellow design with bright yellow shorts that remind you of those old highlighter pens you used to dust off for revision, Cologne wore this bold design in a defeat to Bayern Munich in December, So that s three Pretty standard so far, The European red one, This one is a special kit for Cologne s Europa League campaign They beat Arsenal wearing it in November, The Gunners have had their own bizarre experiences with football kits notably this season s blue away strip in which they have lost eight games in all against such giants as Ostersunds Swansea Nottingham Forest, Arsenal s blue kit is cursed Lost to Ostersunds Lost to Swansea Lost to Bournemouth Lost to Forest Drew with Southampton Lost to Koln Lost to Watford Lost to Liverpool, Cologne s special kit did the job on the day against the Londoners but they failed to get out of the group stages, The white one, To mark the club s th anniversary Cologne opted to wear yet another kit their fifth of the season paying homage to the kit the club wore for their first league title win back in the season, The white jersey with pale pinstripes was reissued for Cologne s Bundesliga defeat against Borussia Dortmund in February, In fact when this shirt is turned inside out you get a different design featuring bolder sponsors and the date of the club being founded so it could be argued that this counts as two shirts instead of one, A post shared by fckoeln on, The design features many things our fans have wanted for a long time such as the old logo Cologne s managing director Alexander Wehrle said Our fans are basically getting two shirts for the price of one, Or eight for the price of seven Alex, Last season s dark grey one, In September Cologne were forced to pair their dark grey jersey with this season s lovely neon shorts to avoid their light grey shirts clashing with Augsburg s white and red trimmed jerseys, Cologne fell to a defeat, The new black one, This is the last one we promise Well so far, Cologne opted to debut another shirt their seventh of the season when they came up against RB Leipzig on Sunday The new black shirt and black shorts were required to avoid clashing with their opposition s red and white kit Looks like the Billy Goats may have finally learnt their lesson with the whole red and white thing, The all black strip proved to be lucky as Cologne went on to win the game, For any hard core Cologne fans out there looking to secure all seven shirts worn this season be warned that it ll probably set you back an estimated although you might get good value if they re forced to wear it again next season They ve got form for that after all, , Is this the most ridiculous last minute winner ever conceded, Here are some of the cheekiest tactics attempted in sport, This manager is really not happy with his new signing, Options to share this content, Is this the most ridiculous last minute winner ever conceded, Here are some of the cheekiest tactics attempted in sport, This
