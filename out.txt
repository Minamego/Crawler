does the Robotics Nanodegree program cost, The program consists of two month long terms EGP per term for a total program cost of EGP, Am I required to pay for both terms up front, No You may register and pay for the first term and then make a decision about the second term at a later date, Is there a free trial period for this program, Like all Udacity programs if within the first seven days of being enrolled in the program you determine that it would be best to not maintain your enrollment you will be refunded all tuition paid, Are there scholarships or financial aid available, We do not currently offer scholarships for the Robotics Nanodegree program, Program Structure, When does the first cohort start and end, The first cohort of students will start their first term on May and complete the term weeks later, How is this Nanodegree program structured, The program is comprised of terms months each with fixed start and end dates Students must successfully complete all assigned projects by the end date for each term to graduate There are projects per term which give you an opportunity to apply the skills you ve learned in the lessons Each project must be submitted for review by one of the expert project reviewers in the Udacity Robotics network Your reviewer will give you detailed feedback on your work and let you know where your project needs improvement if necessary You may submit each project as many times as you like, Will there be a Nanodegree Plus version of this program with the job guarantee, We are not offering Nanodegree Plus for this program However our current global hiring partners which include Bosch iRobot Lockheed Martin X and more provide Udacity students direct and preferential exposure to new jobs We work directly with recruiters and hiring managers at each company to get our students fast tracked into open opportunities, Will there be Udacity Connect sessions held for this program, Due to the singular nature of and requirements for this curriculum we will not be supporting Connect sessions for the Robotics Nanodegree program While students of this program are welcome to attend Connect sessions we will not provide curriculum support at the sessions nor will there be session leads onsite who are equipped to provide specific program guidance and input, Do you offer the opportunity for students to pause their studies for this program, The fixed term nature of the program and the need for maintaining a consistent and stable student body throughout doesn t allow for offering the option to pause your studies, Is this program self paced, The start and end dates of each term are fixed and you must complete all assigned projects by the end dates so to that extent the answer is no it is not self paced You must complete the program within a fixed time period However projects may be submitted at any time during the term and individual project deadlines are recommendations not requirements So within the boundaries of a given term there is some opportunity to work at your own pace But you should plan to follow our recommended timeline as this will best enable you to keep pace with your peers and complete the program on time, Deadline Policy, When we use the term deadline with regards to Nanodegree Program projects we use it in one of two ways, To mean a final deadline for submitting all projects, To refer to ongoing suggested deadlines for individual projects, It is very important to understand the distinctions between the two as your progress in the program is measured against the deadlines we ve established Please see below for an explanation of what each usage means, A final deadline for submitting all projects, In order to graduate a term you must submit all projects by the last day of the term and pass all projects once they are reviewed by a Udacity Reviewer the review may take place after the last day of the term Passing a project means a Udacity Reviewer has marked a project as Meets Specifications, If you do not submit all projects by the end of the term and also pass all projects once they are reviewed You will receive a week extension to complete any outstanding projects You will only receive this extension a maximum of once Once you submit and pass all projects you can enroll in the next term which will potentially be with a later class If you do not submit and pass all projects within the week extension you will be removed from the program, Ongoing suggested deadlines for individual projects, The deadlines you see in your classroom are suggestions for when you should ideally pass each project They are meant to help keep you on track so that you maintain an appropriate pace throughout the program one that will see you graduate on time, Please note that you can submit your project as many times as you need to There are no penalties if you miss these deadlines However you will be at risk of not passing all projects on time if you miss these deadlines and fall behind so it is a recommended best practice to try and meet each suggested deadline, To succeed in this program you need to have significant experience with, Background in the following is

supported on this device, Crystal Palace s late defeat by Liverpool felt like groundhog day according to Eagles manager Roy Hodgson, Mohamed Salah s th minute goal snatched a victory for the Reds and left the hosts two points above the relegation zone, Palace suffered the same fate against Manchester United earlier this month when Nemanja Matic scored in injury time to earn his side a win, It s very disappointing for them to get the winning goal so close to the end of the game said former Liverpool boss Hodgson, Egypt international Salah took a touch before firing past keeper Wayne Hennessey after Andy Robertson had crossed in from the left, Luka Milivojevic had converted from the spot early in the first half to give Palace the lead after Liverpool keeper Loris Karius took out Wilfried Zaha, And Sadio Mane turned in James Milner s cross shortly after the break to level, It feels like a groundhog day when we play against the top teams added Hodgson, In the second half we played well and controlled the ball and created better chances but we also conceded both goals, Liverpool had plenty of chances to score in the first half at Selhurst Park as Salah s curling effort tested Hennessey and Mane went close with two headed efforts, Karius early error looked costly as Palace clung on until half time but Liverpool responded within four minutes of the restart when Milner and Robertson combined down the left to set up Mane, Christian Benteke then missed two clear goalscoring chances in as many minutes before Patrick van Aanholt s fizzing free kick was palmed away by Karius, There were appeals for Mane to be shown a second yellow card he was booked for diving in the first half after he picked up the ball on the edge of the area but referee Neil Swarbrick settled for a free kick, The Reds then completed the comeback when Salah scored his th Premier League goal of the season equalling the league record of scoring in matches in a game season, Salah saves Liverpool s blushes, Liverpool headed to Selhurst Park knowing they have an important week ahead, The Reds host Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League quarter final on Wednesday before making the short trip to Merseyside rivals Everton in next Saturday s Premier League derby, But Jurgen Klopp named a strong starting line up in his th Premier League game in charge despite expectations he would rest several key players, But Liverpool s first half performance did not match the boldness of Klopp s selection as they lacked intensity and imagination against a stubborn Palace defence, Mane s equaliser early in the second half was a good response but Benteke missed two great chances moments later to regain Palace s lead, Liverpool had further chances and so did Palace but it was Salah who once again came to the rescue saving the visitors blushes, Victory takes Liverpool up to second place in the Premier League table at least for a few hours as Manchester United host Swansea at BST, More missed opportunities for Palace, Roy Hodgson s side suffered yet another defeat against a team in the top six and having taken an early lead this was a missed opportunity, Palace were the better side in the first half and deserved to be in front after Zaha had won a penalty when he was clattered by Karius, They then defended well keeping Salah out of action and frustrating Mane, Even after Liverpool had responded and equalised Palace grew in confidence and started to create more in attack, But Benteke missed two golden opportunities to regain the lead and it ultimately proved costly as Salah showed the required prolificacy at the other end, Former Liverpool striker Benteke has missed of the big chances he has had in the Premier League this season more than any other player, Palace have now suffered five defeats in their last six games and are two points above the relegation zone with their rivals all yet to play, After throwing away leads against both Manchester United and Liverpool in the space of a month Salah s late winner will come as yet another blow to the south London side, Major blow for Adam Lallana, Adam Lallana has started just one game for Liverpool this season after struggling with injury, He came on as a second half substitute at Selhurst Park in the hope of gaining more match fitness following a minute cameo for England on Tuesday, But it was not what he or Klopp had hoped for when he hobbled off within three minutes of his introduction, The year old midfielder has played just minutes of Premier League football this season and now looks set to spend more time on the sidelines, It is not good he is really down in the dressing room Klopp said It is really difficult whatever injury it looks like a muscle one, Not a Sadio Mane day Klopp reacts, Media playback is not supported on this device, speaking to BBC Sport It is usual for us that we need to fight here especially after a difficult start but it makes it more special at the end The win was deserved, For me it s a penalty it s clear He is seconds too late going down but it s a penalty With contact how can that be a dive I spoke to the referee at half time, There were a few strange situations today and Mane had to go through minutes of being whistled It was not a Sadio Mane day today I thought he would be sent off for handling the ball I did not understand it but am happy he didn t, Wasteful Palace the best of the stats, Man of the match Andy Robertson, What s next, Crystal Palace travel to Bournemouth in the Premier League

6], url_data=[Accessibility links, BBC navigation, Newcastle United Huddersfield Town, By Gary Rose, BBC Sport, Share this with, Ayoze Perez s late goal gave Newcastle a victory that moved them a big step closer towards Premier League safety and left Huddersfield in danger of dropping back into the Championship, The hosts had looked like being frustrated as they missed a number of chances to take the lead early on against the cautious Terriers, Matt Ritchie was denied one on one by Huddersfield keeper Jonas Lossl before Dwight Gayle saw his lob drop just wide of the post, Only Malaga have failed to score in more games than Huddersfield this season in Europe s top five leagues and they rarely threatened in this encounter, But it looked like they would hold on for an important point until Perez turned home Kenedy s smart cross in the final few minutes to secure a win that lifts Newcastle to th in the table and seven points above the relegation zone, Huddersfield meanwhile remain three points above th placed Southampton who lost at West Ham and are now without a win in their last four Premier League games, Almost time to pop champagne for Newcastle, Newcastle went into the recent international break on the back of an impressive home win against Southampton a result that gave their fans real hope of their side guaranteeing Premier League football for next season, However there was a three week gap between the Saints game and this one against Huddersfield a break that some may have feared would disrupt their momentum, That was far from the case, The hosts dominated from kick off until the final whistle pinning Huddersfield back in their own half for almost the entire game Only poor finishing by Gayle and some decent saves by Lossl kept the scores level heading into the final minutes, Newcastle had lost only one of their previous six Premier League matches before Huddersfield s visit and the arrival of Kenedy on loan from Chelsea has been a key part in that upturn in form, Once again he played a decisive role in this win keeping his calm in front of goal to cross for Perez when the temptation could have been to go for glory a decision that may well have secured another season in the top flight for Newcastle, Toothless Terriers need to find their bite quickly, Huddersfield have only spent one week in the bottom three all season but if they do not develop more bite soon they could drop back into it at just the wrong time, They have now failed to find the back of the net in five of their last six games as they once again paid the price for a cautious approach in a game that required more attacking intent, The Terriers finished without a single shot on target as familiar faults were exposed Their solitary striker Laurent Depoitre showed plenty of endeavour but his task was a thankless one as he often found himself isolated in the Newcastle half, In fact Huddersfield have not scored with any of their last shots in the Premier League since Steve Mounie s goal against West Bromwich Albion in February having played minutes in the division since then, David Wagner s side have never played a system that relies on creating lots of chances but it is worrying for the visitors that the fast paced counter attacking football and high pressing game that helped them make the most of their few opportunities is now rarely on show, Only the poor form of those sides below Huddersfield is providing the Terriers with some breathing space but upcoming home games against Watford and Everton are looking increasingly crucial to determining whether they will avoid an immediate return to the Championship, We needed to win what they said, It was an important game and we needed to win They are a good team well organised We didn t take our chances and in the second half there was a risk we could be caught but we stayed calm, Ayoze Perez was doing a good job He needed to stay calm in that position move around the position and take his chance, It was a great atmosphere and the team and fans together are stronger Forty points is the figure we are looking for and that s it, It s a disappointing result for us but it s my job to analyse this in the right way Our idea was to frustrate them and sit deeper to minimise their clear cut chances and hurt them on the counter attack, In the first half Newcastle had good opportunities but in the second half I thought it was working for us We had a big opportunity with Scott Malone at the final whistle we didn t use the chances and this is why we lost the game, The attitude fighting spirit and how they followed the game plan was fantastic I think we were worth a point, Best since Pards the stats, What next, Newcastle head to Leicester on Saturday April BST while Huddersfield are at

minute equaliser that denied Watford victory at Vicarage Road, The year old substitute pounced on a long free kick to smash home from close range as the Cherries came back for the second time in the game, Defoe who rejoined the Dorset side in the summer on a free transfer had scored three goals this season until an ankle injury in December kept him sidelined until late February, The England striker has now scored goals in the th minute or later in the Premier League more than any other player, I am delighted with Jermain s finish it could be a huge one at the end of the season Howe told BBC Sport, He is an incredible player and person Coming back from injury he has looked sharp I expected him to come on and make a difference and it was a fantastic finish, Kiko Femenia had given Watford the lead on minutes volleying in Jose Holebas s cross from just inside the box, Holebas then gifted the Cherries a penalty just before half time as he pushed the ball away with his hand to stop Jordon Ibe getting to a rebound after Orestis Karnezis had saved Junior Stanislas shot, Joshua King sent Karnezis the wrong way to roll his penalty in, But the Hornets restored their lead four minutes after the break Roberto Pereyra s low shot trickling past Asmir Begovic, Bournemouth who hit the bar through Nathan Ake s header in the fourth minute failed to create many chances in the second half with Defoe going closest with a header in the th minute seven minutes after coming on, Watford looked set for three points that would have gone a long way to ensuring their Premier League safety until Defoe s goal, Both teams move to points nine points clear of the the relegation zone with Bournemouth staying in th and Watford a place behind, Watford lost two points, the number of points to guarantee staying up in the previous seasons is so Watford can at least take consolation in having passed that mark, Following successive league defeats by Arsenal and Liverpool conceding eight goals this was an improvement, Defoe s equaliser prevented Watford from recording four straight home wins in the top flight for the first time since December under Graham Taylor, But they are still unbeaten at Vicarage Road since a defeat by Swansea on December, The defence will be of concern to Javi Gracia King s penalty means the Hornets have conceded goals in the first half of Premier League games this season more than any other side, I can be disappointed because have lost two points in extra time said Gracia But I am very proud of my players and squad I can be happy with them, We were twice up in the scoresheet but it wasn t enough we must take more advantage of the chances we had, Cherries are the comeback kings, Media playback is not supported on this device, Bournemouth have now gained points from losing positions this season more than any other side, It s a great thing to have in your armoury to know you can keep coming back but obviously we don t want to keep falling behind Howe told Sky Sports, Defoe said We ve got that mentality where we keep going to final whistle we ve scored a lot of late goals this season, They do have an injury worry for their next

Anthony Joshua Feeding maintaining and training a champion, By Luke Reddy, BBC Sport in Cardiff, Share this with, Media playback is not supported on this device, As Anthony Joshua shadow boxes around the ring in Sheffield a small army decide if his muscles need icing if he looks well rested and if he s done enough to deserve some dessert after dinner, This team of people are in many ways the enforcers pushing a forceful athlete closer to greatness they tell him to do things he does not want to do and make sure he can do what needs to be done, From the nutritionist who splits his time between Joshua and Manchester United to the trainer who monitors the IBF and WBA world heavyweight champion s sleep this is a support network many athletes can only dream of, Hit the numbers chef, As Joshua is put through a pad workout days before his unification bout with WBO title holder Joseph Parker nutritionist Mark Ellison is sat before what looks like a CCTV screen and he duly turns on a camera system which will film the ring from multiple angles, It lends a technical breakdown of every Joshua move and is part of a wider system which links into a global network so Britain s amateur fighters who also use this base can scout opponents prior to Olympic Games or the forthcoming Commonwealth Games, Today the focus is a former decorated amateur as Joshua s skin begins to glisten with sweat just minutes into his workout, Much has been made of Joshua s weight for the Parker bout given he scaled more than st a career high last time out Talk of weight versus speed provides an easy angle for media For Ellison the issue is not a primary focus, People talk about weight but with Josh the challenge is just making sure he has the energy for these sessions says Ellison who also works for Manchester United, He s a big guy He moves trains and does things that other heavyweights don t do, You don t see many heavyweights out for km runs He s built like a sprinter in some ways and not only can he run fast but he can do km at a good pace too, The volume he does amazes me and one thing I will say is the human traits you see in players who have won things at Manchester United and those in AJ are the same They are completely dedicated, Ellison shows me the spreadsheet he receives on a Sunday detailing the five days of training Joshua faces for the forthcoming week From there he attributes a daily diet of around calories to the easier days and to the harder ones, He plots the grams of fat and protein for each day and then passes these figures to Joshua s personal chef who will cook to hit the numbers outlined, It is detailed and the menu for the so called easier day of training Ellison shows me would fit nicely in any eaterie Milkshakes provide easy nutrition between meals while there is room for caffeinated chewing gums and even the odd treat, On heavy days we ramp up the carbs adds Ellison He may have desserts added in a meringue nest with some fresh fruits maybe Meringues are great as they are high in carbs a bit of protein but very low in fat, He s brilliant and doesn t need much pushing with buying into the nutrition The only thing he struggles with is getting in the ice baths and also monitoring his recovery as we try to get him to record his sleep mood and muscle soreness so we can make adjustments, Media playback is not supported on this device, The trainer physio chef circle, You get in and you think you re going to die says Joshua s long term trainer Robert McCracken, The challenge of cajoling Joshua into the minus degree ice bath often falls to physio Ian Gatt, If Ellison s mantra focused on energy levels rather than weight concerns Gatt s is undoubtedly honed in on preventing injury rather than reacting to it, The worst thing I want is AJ coming to me and saying his shoulder hurts and the pain started two weeks ago says Gatt who wrapped Joshua s hands before the London Olympic final, The process is from warm up to cool down It could be using resistance bands to make sure he warms up certain areas of the body it could be making sure he ices his hands after sparring, So we work to prevent Putting him on a treatment table is the worst thing to do as we d create a dependency, Gatt tries to stay away from the simple massage many armchair fans may think elite sportsmen rely on Acupuncture is sometimes used and it is clear Joshua deserves credit for his diligence as many of the recovery stretches and exercises Gatt calls upon require added time and effort from the champion, Joshua is now skipping his white t shirt stuck to his sodden body He asked GB Boxing if he could base himself here shortly after turning professional and stated he would represent the sport with distinction in return, He is demanding of what music offers the soundtrack to his workout until a playlist to his liking settles into the kind of smooth rhythm he hopes to showcase against Parker, Speaking to Gatt underlines how smooth the background operation must be too, If Joshua reports any kind of niggle Gatt will speak to McCracken to modify training Ellison will then also be informed to adjust the necessary nutritional values for the day prompting changes for the chef, All the while in the background Joshua s PR and management schedule his movements in order to minimise disruption while maximizing exposure, It is a harmonious circle in the most destructive of sports, I will groan moan and whine at you, And then there is McCracken The man who guided Carl Froch to world level and who spends so much of his time in this gym overseeing GB s amateur athletes as they use the five rings on offer to hone their skills in pursuit of medals just as Joshua did, Former world super middleweight champion Richie Woodhall works with the amateurs here and points me to the altitude tent in the corner of the room wincing as he explains what conducting a pad session is like in there, McCracken s eyes briefly widen as Joshua throws a shot at one of his pads After contact comes instruction delivered softly Their understanding is tangible, He is a nice person he s genuine it s not an act says McCracken But he s a natural fighter You see him sparring and every now and again you see a switch go off and you have to tell him to ease back, At the minute it s not hard for me as he s driven and wants to be the very best, I was with Froch and he had a fantastic career but the last three or four fights were hard work for him It was a chore to motivate himself It was genuinely difficult to do a week camp AJ has not got there yet, McCracken openly admits he did not want Joshua to face Wladimir Klitschko in stating it was three fights too early to face a man of such experience, It is a testament to their relationship that they reached a way forward Some trainers would have been ardent but through communication they agreed on and plotted a glorious night at Wembley Stadium, And now with his man the most recognisable active boxer on earth McCracken says there are moments where he administers reminders if Joshua is not delivering what he needs, He has to go to bed on time which no one wants to do No later than pm adds McCracken, Then it s weighing yourself working with the nutritionist then he has to listen to me to tell him how bad he has been in the session, Then it s studying things strategy carrying that out in training implementing it in spars If you don t I will groan moan and whine at you when you re very tired with a big headguard on and you have three sparring partners who only do a few rounds each ready to come at you flat out It s never ending, If I tell him that wasn t good enough I m sure he thinks oh leave it out will you, He goes a bit quiet with me That s a nice way of saying it, The torture of McCracken s camp will be worthwhile if Joshua adds the WBO title to his collection on Saturday AJ would be one step closer to holding all four of the marquee division s honours, Now that s an achievement worthy of some meringue and a celebratory ice bath, Share this with, Find out more, Top Stories, Related to this story, Also in Sport, The only thing Joshua struggles with is ice baths

World Cup countries have played their final games before they have to file their provisional squads as an action packed international break comes to an end, Hat tricks thrashings tactical concerns selection dilemmas it s been a revealing week about some of the contenders for the trophy, BBC Sport in conjunction with has looked at the seven favourites excluding England to see how they are shaping up for the summer in Russia, Argentina, Two time champions Argentina lost the final to Germany At the age of this is the last World Cup where Lionel Messi will be at the peak of his powers in fact the Barcelona forward says he could quit international football after the tournament without the injured Messi on Tuesday, Argentina almost didn t qualify A Messi hat trick in their last qualifier a took them to Russia In November they beat the World Cup hosts and lost to Nigeria in friendlies And in the recent batch of games both of which Messi missed with a minor injury they without overly impressing before being demolished in Madrid, Argentina are putting all their eggs in the Messi basket really So much so that boss Jorge Sampaoli is considering not even bringing Paulo Dybala or Mauro Icardi two of the top five scorers in Serie A to Russia Sampaoli who only took over for the last four qualifiers is unsure either player can adjust to his system, Sampaoli says this is going to be Messi s team but conceded in his forthcoming book Messi has a revolver put to his head called the World Cup and if he doesn t win it he s shot and killed As a result he can t enjoy his talent The negativity surrounding international football damages Messi, I was not so keen on those Sampaoli quotes about this being Messi s team I don t think that s the right message to send It s like they ve got players and Messi, But this is Argentina they have amazing players everywhere on the pitch OK they have the best ever Even for Messi I don t think it s a good thing it just adds more pressure, Can you find a way to play both Dybala and Messi in the same team Dybala likes to occupy the same spaces and play in the same way as Messi does Do they step on each others toes Obviously Messi is the better player Does that preclude Dybala from going to Russia I don t think it does, But it s very clear the striker Sampaoli trusts most is Gonzalo Higuain because of the all round game he brings his willingness to sacrifice himself for the team He works so hard that when he does get a chance on goal he s too tired and misses it, Argentina unlike most other World Cup teams are only expected to play once more before the tournament away to Israel on June, Belgium, Belgium have never won a major tournament with their best World Cup run a semi final spot They have probably their most talented squad of all time filled with Premier League stars and will be hoping to build on quarter final eliminations in their past two tournaments, Belgium stormed into the World Cup with nine wins and a draw from qualifiers finishing nine points clear of Greece Since then they have drawn against Mexico beaten Japan in November and thrashed Saudi Arabia their only friendly in this round of games on Tuesday, Different year different manager same story Marc Wilmots tactics were criticised after last eight exits at the World Cup and Euro Roberto Martinez replaced him before World Cup qualification and they are now unbeaten in games But after a draw with Mexico in November playmaker Kevin de Bruyne said We still put too much on our talents As long as we don t have a good tactical system we will have difficulties against countries like Mexico, When you have a player like Kevin de Bruyne publicly questioning your tactics and formation I think you should worry I m not a big fan of Martinez Wilmots was terrible I think Martinez is not much better, Every single other manager says the two friendlies in March are so important because it s the last games before you announce your World Cup squad What do Belgium do They don t have the first game when everyone plays on Friday and then the second game no offence to Saudi Arabia is against Saudi Arabia, They have the talent to win the World Cup but I m not sure about the dynamic, Belgium play three friendlies in June against Portugal Egypt and Costa Rica before their World Cup opener against Panama, Brazil, The most successful team in World Cup history with five trophies On a good run of results they will be looking to rebuild that reputation after their thrashing by the same opponents in their home tournament four years ago Joint favourites with Germany to win, Brazil went unbeaten in their final World Cup qualifiers only losing the opening game to Chile to finish points clear of second placed Uruguay Since then they have beaten Japan and drawn against England in November before a and victory over the world champions in Berlin, The big question is about the availability of Neymar who Brazil are hopeful will make the World Cup Their fourth top scorer of all time despite only being is recovering from successful surgery on a broken foot and might not return for Paris St Germain this season In February boss Tite revealed the names of players who were guaranteed a place in his squad injuries aside, Brazil have great strength in depth in some areas Gabriel Jesus and Roberto Firmino are probably battling for one starting spot up front while Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson is likely to be back up for Roma s in form Alisson Becker, Tite admits his side are still haunted by saying the from the World Cup is like a ghost, I think Brazil have more balance than people give them credit for We talk about their talent going forward Neymar Philippe Coutinho Roberto Firmino Douglas Costa Willian But if you look at what they ve got in midfield Fernandinho can balance the team And Shakhtar midfielder Fred I don t think it s a coincidence Pep Guardiola wouldn t mind having him at Manchester City next season, Brazil look much more a team than Argentina do We have to see how Neymar comes back and in what kind of condition, was at the win over Germany It was more important psychologically than technically but a few things stood out Willian has cemented a place in the starting XI and it also seems Roberto Firmino s great season at Liverpool still isn t enough for him to pip Gabriel Jesus to the striker position, Manager Tite will also struggle with the fact Coutinho slotted in well on the left side of the pitch Neymar s favourite spot, Brazil play friendlies against Croatia and Austria in June before their World Cup campaign, France, France have won the World Cup once when they hosted it in They have a talented crop of players including three of the five most expensive footballers in history but there are question marks about how to turn these stars into a team, France qualified for the World Cup with seven wins from games finishing four points above Sweden In November they beat Wales and drew with world champions Germany in friendlies But they blew a lead to lose at home to Colombia on Friday before following that up with a, They ve got the players but can Didier Deschamps work out his best XI Paul Pogba was dropped for the Colombia friendly with his complicated situation at Manchester United although he returned to score against Colombia, Les Bleus were error prone at the back in the loss to Colombia at Stade de France Samuel Umtiti Raphael Varane or Laurent Koscielny at the back, And while a nice problem to have who misses out from Mbappe Ousmane Dembele Antoine Griezmann Thomas Lemar Kingsley Coman Anthony Martial Alexandre Lacazette and Olivier Giroud, Hugo Lloris said Colombia are a squad who aren t as talented as us but at least they play like a team and that s not what we did He was spot on He was really angry and to make Hugo Lloris angry you need to push a lot, Colombia changed their tactics at half time and Deschamps didn t react to it or change anything even though he looked at his team collapsing and crumbling, I m not sure the is strong enough to win you a World Cup They were overrun against Colombia A big country like Germany Brazil or Spain you might struggle there, France play friendlies at the end of May and the start of June against three teams who have not qualified for the World Cup Republic of Ireland Italy and the United States, Germany, The current holders and one more World Cup will equal Brazil s record of five They are ranked as the number one team in the world and joint favourites with Brazil to lift the trophy in Russia, Germany won all World Cup qualifiers to cruise into this summer s tournament They were unbeaten in games following friendly draws against England France and on Friday but then, One of the main questions about their squad is will Manuel Neuer be fit from his broken metatarsal in time Their undoubted first choice keeper before his injury has not played since September but the form of Marc Andre ter Stegen means he might have to settle for a place on the bench if he returns at all, In Timo Werner who has scored seven goals in caps they finally have the proper striker they missed in their Euro semi final run Mario Gotze who scored the winner in the final might not even go to Russia because of his poor form while Marco Reus was not in their most recent squad, The big question is does Sami Khedira still have the engine and ability to link up two different parts of the same team I think Ilkay Gundogan still has a chance to make a claim to be a different type of midfielder next to Toni Kroos but then do you need Emre Can to add the height and muscle, If Manuel Neuer returns by April I think there s enough time for him to go to the World Cup If he plays two games and is Manuel Neuer as we know him Joachim Low will take him Otherwise he ll stay behind, Timo Werner was one of the real winners of the Spain game He didn t score but he caused so many problems for Spain He s definitely on the plane, Germany play Austria and Saudi Arabia in June before the World Cup starts, Portugal, Portugal have reached the semi finals of the World Cup twice in and They went out in the group stages but come into the tournament as European champions Plus they have Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal squeaked into the World Cup thanks to a in their winner takes all final group game In November they beat Saudi Arabia and drew with USA This month Ronaldo scored twice in injury time as they but they followed that up with a hugely unimpressive defeat by the Netherlands who have not even qualified, As always Ronaldo even at the age of is pivotal to their hopes Their talisman whose double against Egypt made him the third top scorer of all time in international football has scored goals in games for Portugal since Euro But a combination of injuries and loss of form to other players including Andre Gomes and Renato Sanches means Fernando Santos says he is only sure of his World Cup squad, Let s remember how Portugal got to the final of the European Championship and won it It wasn t just Ronaldo They shared the goals around the team They were the ugly duckling in that tournament They ve got undoubted talent, Andre Silva has come into form for AC Milan and had a good record in qualifying As a natural striker that s something a bit different from the team they had who won the European Championship, Portugal play three friendlies in May and June before the World Cup against two of England s group opponents Tunisia and Belgium as well as Algeria, Spain, The champions were eliminated in the group stages last time but look much stronger heading into the event culminating in They are yet to lose in games under boss Julen Lopetegui scoring in each of them, Since finishing top of a qualifying group containing Italy with nine wins and one draw from games Spain have extended their unbeaten run to games A win over Costa Rica and a draw against Russia in November was followed by a and the Argentina rout in Madrid, Spain looked good in qualifying and in their recent friendlies Andres Iniesta is still pulling the strings Isco has hit goalscoring form and highly decorated centre backs Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique remain in front of David de Gea arguably the best goalkeeper in the world, The main query is who will play up front Alvaro Morata was not even named in their recent squad following his poor Chelsea form Valencia striker Rodrigo started against Germany and Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa got the nod against Argentina with both players scoring when they got the chance, The striker position has been a difficult one for Spain for a number of years Lopetegui was the youth team manager and got a lot out of Morata when they won the Euro Under s in Israel a few years ago The issue he s got is that the guy he knows and trusts isn t playing regularly enough or showing what we know he can show at Chelsea, You feel it s an unresolved issue for Spain Who is the best striker to fit their system Diego Costa is so different he adds a lot but maybe doesn t link up perfectly and Rodrigo is the opposite He s a quick small flexible striker but doesn t give you anything at corners or free kicks the ugly dirty goals you sometimes need, In theory Morata is the best of both worlds on paper He can lead the line and he can play but not if he s totally shot on confidence, Spain play Switzerland and Tunisia in friendlies before the World Cup, How are England s World Cup opponents faring, See above for Belgium, Tunisia who went through qualifying unbeaten are in the World Cup for a fifth time but have never gone past the group stage They are unbeaten in seven games including and Costa Rica in their recent friendlies, BBC World Service s John Bennett who was at the win over Costa Rica in Nice said Tunisia really impressed me Comfortable on the ball positive and well organised they totally outplayed Costa Rica, Former Sunderland attacker Wahbi Khazri was the goalscorer and star man He may not have made a great impact in the Premier League but he is the player England have to be wary of Everything goes through him He had licence to roam the attacking third of the pitch, They have recently recruited the French born quartet of Yohan Benalouane the Leicester defender Troyes midfielder Seifeddine Khaoui Montpellier midfielder Ellyes Skhiri and Chateauroux keeper Mouez Hassen, Panama qualified for the World Cup for the first time thanks to a late Roman Torres winner against Costa Rica that knocked the United States out The next day was by the president, However since then they have struggled in friendlies beating Grenada before a defeat by Iran and draw with Wales in November and losses to Denmark and this month, BBC Sport recently spent a day with centre back Torres, How about some of the other notable teams in the tournament, Hopes are not high for World Cup hosts who are ranked rd in the world They have won just one of their last eight games losing to Brazil and to France in their two most recent, They lack any good centre backs and preparations are going so badly manager Stanislav Cherchesov has admitted he is starting everything from scratch again, World Cup debutants are looking to build on their run to the last eight at Euro However their results have not been particularly impressive since securing qualification beating Indonesia and drawing with Qatar and suffering defeats against Czech Republic Mexico and Peru, Iceland will be desperate to see star player Gylfi Sigurdsson return in time with the Everton playmaker in danger of missing the rest of the Premier League season with a knee injury, are in the World Cup for the first time since after defeating New

not supported on this device, Adam Peaty has pretty much won breaststroke, Olympic champion world champion European champion Commonwealth champion British champion world record holder nearly four years unbeaten, The year old already boasts a truly astonishing list of medals records awards and achievements, But it s the stinging prospect of tasting an oh so rare defeat that continues to spur Peaty on, I have this thought quite a bit what happens if I do lose he told BBC Sport But that only motivates me to go even further and push new limits, There s a saying that if you cut the head off a snake two more will grow and that s exactly what will happen with me, It s that attitude that ensures Peaty s ongoing utter dominance in a discipline and sport where the winners are normally separated by the finest of fine margins, His Olympic m title at Rio was pretty much guaranteed after metres with Peaty s winning time more than seconds clear of his nearest rival, In a two year spell from Peaty won m breaststroke gold at every major swimming event with his seconds at the Rio Olympics the incredible end point, In July Peaty s name was the only one appearing on a top list of the fastest m long course times in m breaststroke history, Now he has on his mind his name for attempting to become the first swimmer to break the second mark in his event, The context behind the medals and records is bewilderingly impressive, Postponing the happy time, To keep so far ahead of the field Peaty s schedule in the build up to the Commonwealth Games in Australia has been every bit as tough as you would expect and a bit more, Success comes at a cost though The swimmers tapering utopia wasn t an option to Peaty prior to at the British Championships in Edinburgh earlier this month, Big competitions normally mean a period of rest and reduced training but there was no luxury with bigger fish to fry in April and in August, The main two events of the season for us are the Commonwealths and the Europeans so we would rather rest fully for them than miss too much training Peaty explained, There was no strategic advantage resting for the British Championships We would probably then lose out at the Commonwealths We went straight through it to see what we got, What we Peaty and got was none too shabby either, Getting and were two amazing times for this time of year said Uttoxeter born Peaty, Obviously the tapering now comes along which is our happy time where we rest get a little bit more twitchy and a bit faster so we are looking at pretty fast times come Gold Coast, And what better place to showcase any further improvements than at the Commonwealth Games the starting point for an incredible career to date, Where Peaty was born, Marshall who still oversees Peaty s progress in her role as the National Lead Centre Coach at Loughborough said the Australia trip was just one part of a complicated journey building up to the Olympic Games in, Planning has to be meticulous for the top swimmers with a hectic year of competition taking Peaty and co to within two years of Tokyo, The British Championships were an interesting meet this year because our focus is the Commonwealth Games and primarily the European Championships Marshall explained, But, It was his first ever win at a major championships and he should go there and absolutely embrace that environment and look at where he has come in the past four years and see if he can demonstrate again what is he great at, The signs are good His times in once again winning the m and m breaststroke British titles were better than expected for the this stage of the season, From Adam s perspective I couldn t be happier Marshall added, He has had a really hard winter block he has lifted really well in the gym and his nutrition and every little tool it s like a Formula car and every kind of part in terms of his wheels his engine it is all in really good shape, Any event any race no matter what the timing and how it fits in with his schedule and the bigger picture tends to awaken Peaty s fierce competitive streak Much of that can be traced back to the fear factor of not being the best, No time to sleep, If I do lose it will be their mistake because me and Mel will work even harder to make sure it doesn t happen again Peaty said, That s the philosophy I have had When I took a few defeats I thought this isn t going to happen again and I came back even stronger, Since I haven t been defeated That s not an arrogance thing it s more of a confidence thing I work harder than probably anyone in the pool that does breaststroke, That s part of sport A really talented guy could come along tomorrow and put a really good time out and I will do my best to attack it, That s why in any sport you cannot afford to sleep because you will get overtaken, This will hopefully be my fourth year undefeated so it is something to celebrate I am looking forward to the competition and seeing who is popping out there But at the same time it is a bit of fun, Australia s insane atmosphere, Hopefully I will get near my world records but I won t be at a loss if I don t because the Europeans are around the corner as well, I think I can get within the region of If it s faster it s faster if it s slower it s slower but definitely under it s just how far I get under that, Peaty says racing in Australia will be a one off kind of experience, The fans out there will be insane and the pool is crazy its and that in a m radius is a lot of people, And it will be outdoors which is different for us possibly new challenges but whatever challenge it is we will be more than prepared, The new challenges are keeping Peaty fresh Despite all his success he still maintains his enthusiasm and mostly knows what he is striving for, A legacy is the most important thing for me now he said, Once you achieve what there is to achieve you do go what is next, But I don t think I have reached that stage where I feel wow I have done everything, I still feel I have something in there that I haven t achieved and I don t know what it is yet, I think once I do I will probably call it a day I have years left in this sport and that will hopefully take me to LA but you don t know what is around the corner and that is the beauty of sport and the risk we play and I am ready to play it every day, Analysis, Adam Peaty is by far the most dominant male swimmer in the world at present and he s redefined what was thought possible in the breaststroke events, Since breaking the previous m world record of seconds set by Cameron van der Burgh at London he has lowered the mark twice more and in total by a stunning seconds to its current mark of, That kind of progression in a sprint event is unheard of in the modern era of the sport and has stunned even, Phelps said the Briton s m gold at Rio was one of the grossest swims he d ever seen adding he was glad he didn t have to race him, High praise indeed but any comparisons with Phelps should be ignored He although strongest at butterfly was a multi event specialist who also won Olympic titles in individual medley and freestyle events which Peaty will not, The English swimmer is an entirely different beast a thoroughbred specialist so comparisons with track athlete Usain Bolt are potentially more appropriate, They re once in a generation freaks of nature who are able to combine phenomenal physique with a near perfect technique and are fuelled by a relentless desire to keep pushing the boundaries of the human body in pursuit of further record breaking success, But for one false start in Bolt went undefeated at the World Championships and Olympic Games between and a period of domination Peaty is only halfway through himself, However remember that Bolt s historic individual world records came only in a month period encompassing the Beijing Olympics and Berlin World Championships whereas Peaty s marks across m and m events have spanned two years and there is every suggestion he will go quicker, Inspired to try swimming, Find out how to get into swimming with our, With the major focus for being the European Championships rather than the Commonwealth Games and no serious contenders likely to offer a major threat in either event I m not convinced Project will be achieved this year, It may be Tokyo before we see Peaty able to lower his already monumental effort from Rio but he is a man for the biggest of occasions and what better way to defend his Olympic title than with a time which could remain unbeaten for decades, Share this with, Find out more,

way into the st Century It s dazzling stuff writes Nicholas Barber, Steven Spielberg s hectic sci fi action adventure Ready Player One is set half in the real world and half in virtual reality so it s not surprising that two of its characters should discuss the differences between those competing realms What s striking is that the characters should have their discussion in the middle of a furious gun battle in a zero gravity disco and yet you can somehow follow both their arguments and the course of the shoot out, Spielberg isn t just making this territory his own but demonstrating that it was his all along, It s dazzling stuff Recently a generation of directors has been paying homage to Spielberg s popcorn films in Super Jurassic World and Stranger Things for example but with Ready Player One he proves with stunning aplomb that no one does Spielberg quite like Spielberg No one has more empathy with pasty American kids from broken homes No one packs scenes with so much information or elaborate action set pieces with so much energy while ensuring that you always know what s going on and why, And Spielberg isn t just competing with his imitators and his s self He is blasting his way into the st Century As his spectacular film travels back and forth between a dingy Orwellian dystopia and a computer generated dream world he stampedes across territory occupied by Terry Gilliam James Cameron Christopher Nolan and the Wachowskis not to mention the directors of The Lego Movie He isn t just making this territory his own but demonstrating that it was his all along, Adapted from the best selling novel by Ernest Cline and scripted by Cline and Zak Penn Ready Player One is set in the year Its orphaned hero Wade Tye Sheridan lives in a grey Ohio ghetto called The Stacks where higgledy piggledy skyscrapers are made of mobile homes piled on top of each other and held together with scaffolding This opening setting would be enough to occupy most films but no sooner have we glimpsed Wade s vertiginous home than he slips on his VR gloves and helmet and flits across to the OASIS an online role playing game, Most of the population passes most of its time in this game it seems The America of is so rundown that it makes sense to cross over to an infinite digital wonderland where you can live in every film you ve ever seen On a first viewing I spotted King Kong the chest burster from Alien the DeLorean from Back to the Future the Tardis from Doctor Who the Tyrannosaurus from Spielberg s own Jurassic Park and about other pop culture icons But the film invites you to rewatch it repeatedly pausing regularly until you ve ticked off all the references Each crowded frame is like a Where s Wally spread for Comic Con regulars, Naturally once people are in the OASIS they tend to choose avatars who are slimmer taller and generally less human than they are Wade becomes a white and blue skinned alien boy band dreamboat named Parzival and his online friends include a punky manga babe Art mis Olivia Cooke and a hulking cyborg Aech Lena Waithe neither of whom he has ever met in reality They all love the virtual thrill of climbing Mount Everest visiting casino space stations machine gunning opponents and racing around Manhattan in their souped up cars hence the DeLorean but they have a specific mission to keep them occupied too, The OASIS we learn was designed by a fragile genius James Halliday Spielberg s late period muse Mark Rylance and his ousted business partner Ogden Morrow Simon Pegg a particularly apt casting choice given that the film amps up the nerd tastic sensory bombardment which he and Edgar Wright developed in their sitcom Spaced Halliday is now dead but he has left an Easter egg behind in the OASIS anyone who can complete three challenges within the game will be handed sole executive control of his trillion dollar firm Nolan Sorrento Ben Mendelsohn the rat like boss of a rival tech company devotes endless resources to figuring out Halliday s riddles aided and abetted by an amusingly intimidating but whiny sidekick called i R k TJ Miller literally an online troll But the heartfelt geekery of Wade Parzival and his friends gives them the edge Regardless of what their parents may have told them spending their childhoods in front of a screen was actually sound preparation for later life, If pop culture is eating itself this is the feast to end all feasts, What this convoluted but comprehensible premise means is that for most of Ready Player One we are watching Wade playing a video game at one key stage we re watching Wade play a video game within a video game But Spielberg and his team convince us to care about what s happening both in the OASIS and out of it Even when Wade is essentially a CGI cartoon character hurtling around an artificial planet at helter skelter speed the film is making piquant points about corporate advertising the internet and the human urge to appear bigger and better than we are Sorrento s avatar looks suspiciously like Superman Some viewers will still be turned off by a narrative which separates itself from reality for so much of the running time But it s horribly easy to believe that one day we ll all be plugged into a game like the OASIS and a lot sooner than, Having said that Ready Player One did leave me feeling slightly sorry for today s pre teen and teenage cinema goers because they so rarely get to see a new fantasy film which doesn t nod and wink to older ones Back in the past you didn t need to pass an exam to enjoy Back to the Future whereas the current Star Wars and Marvel movies assume an encyclopedic knowledge of all sorts of films television series games books and comics But I think that Spielberg is aware of what a headache these nostalgia fests can be Despite its name the OASIS is cluttered and exhausting rather than peaceful and calm, Besides if any film should be allowed to let its geek flag fly it s Ready Player One which clearly aims to be the ultimate celebration of the fanboy and fangirl mindset If pop culture is eating itself this is the feast to end all feasts You could also argue that Spielberg is the godfather of this kind of coach potato cross referencing I can still remember going to see ET The Extra Terrestrial when it came out and being startled when ET spotted someone dressed up as Yoda for Hallowe en How could one science fiction blockbuster joke about another completely different science fiction blockbuster My young mind was blown Thirty five years on Spielberg has blown my not so young mind

with, Media playback is not supported on this device, Following a Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee DCMS report that said Sir Bradley Wiggins and Team Sky crossed an ethical line by using drugs that are allowed under anti doping rules to enhance performance instead of just for medical purposes Wiggins talks exclusively to BBC Sport s Dan Roan, Here is the full transcript of his interview, No We didn t not at any point in my career did we cross the ethical line As I have said before I had a medical condition that I went to a doctor this has been being treated since when I was diagnosed with it through the doctors at British Cycling at that time, This was the treatment I was prescribed for that particular occasion which was seven years ago now under specialist supervision as well and in place with the rules at that time which was you were allowed to apply for the use of this medication, It wasn t performance enhancing in the sense that for me I had this problem I had problems with asthma attacks I had problems with breathing that flared up through pollen season This was an anti inflammatory drug that was taken to prevent that happening so I could compete on the same level that I had all year and on the same level with my rivals, This wasn t a medication that was abused in order to gain an advantage, That hurts me actually Shane knows exactly why I was taking that medication My asthma inhalers that I had been on throughout my career I had complained of these problems during the Dauphine complained after the Dauphine I went to see a specialist outside of the team in order to see what we could do what would I be able to do in order to combat this or at least prevent it from happening so I could compete at the highest level at the peak of the season when I had worked to that point, That really hurts me that someone like Shane would say that, I don t know what his motivation is that s all I ll say, I am a rider riding for Team Sky the biggest team in the world at that point I am paid as the team leader and as most riders in any sport not just cycling if you ve got niggles problems a knee injury common cold you go to the doctor in the team, We are constantly there We are hypochondriacs as athletes especially coming to the height of the season the biggest race of the year whether it is the Olympic Games or the Tour de France, So it was completely under medical need and this whole thing has been a complete mess of innuendo and rumour and nothing has been substantiated and I am having to deal with the fall out of that now Which is almost impossible How do I do it There have been no medical records to back that up or substantiate what s been said So I am kind of left in the middle here now trying to pick up the pieces, I understand the way this whole thing has played out over the last months it s been a long old process I have not been able to speak until this point because we have had a legal investigation going on with UK Anti Doping Ukad I didn t want to jeopardise that because I was fighting for my life I have got a malicious allegation made by an anonymous source to start with and I have got to now somehow feed my way through, I acted as a witness to the Ukad investigation that was all I was told I was This one the report I have not heard anything since this thing started and at the th hour last week I was asked if I would like to comment on it I was asked five questions none of the questions were the current allegations that have been made One and a half of the answers were published in the report, The first time I am aware of being accused of anything was today At least I now know what I am being accused of because the last months has all been dilly dallying about innuendo no one has actually said for legal reasons because they can t because it s libellous because now we have got to the stage where they have used parliamentary privilege to make it legal being able to say it without repercussions and now they are of the opinion that this is what we were doing, So I have got no comeback on this this is now taken as fact I have now got to prove that this is wrong, I have described that in the past The landscape at the time I had won everything that season I was doing a book in three or four days with a ghost writer I am still competing at the highest level and I have discussed about showing weakness to your opponent I have talked about my asthma before on the front of Asthma UK magazine back in after the Olympic Games talking about the problems I had over the years with that, Because of the type of grass pollen I am allergic to It was around this period The grass pollen goes in seasons and this particular strain of grass pollen I was allergic to it was at a heightened period during June and July, I answered these questions before Why didn t you take it in Because I was racing indoors I didn t have these problems These problems flared up riding through fields and we are riding for three weeks at a time through France it was the biggest race of the year I had won everything that season I wasn t going to jeopardise the work we had put in at that stage, I never used it in competition without a TUE So until I had that piece of paper and that document that said I was authorised to take it it was never took Out of competition I had an injection after the Giro d Italia when I came out with a knee problem and I had an injection into the knee socket to solve that problem Then under the rules at that time you couldn t race for two weeks so I didn t race for two months after that until the Tour of Poland, Yes, That s completely malicious That is an allegation that has been made by an unsubstantiated I would like to see some evidence to back that up, It s in one paragraph in the report and then never mentioned again Also if this was the case why hasn t this piece of evidence come to light under the legal investigation with Ukad This is the first time it has come to light It seems very odd it has come to light in this parliamentary hearing and not before now, Absolutely I refute that This is malicious this This is someone trying to smear me, I would love to know who it is I think it would answer a lot of questions, What do they base that on, No it s not true at all There was medical need for it This was about bringing me back to a level playing field so I can compete at the same level as I had done all season up to that point, A lot of that period was about me maintaining weight I was already at race weight at the Dauphine why would I jeopardise that by taking more This was about me having a problem going to the team doctors flagging this problem then them seeking a way of treating it under no circumstances in my career was this ever used or suggested that it would be performance enhancing it wasn t about that, The rules at the time under an application of a TUE It s not just going into a chemist and going I ll have that there was a process you have a specialist report it goes to the UCI cycling s governing body they then decide their panel then decides whether you are granted this TUE or not Until that application comes back and I can take that medication, not true That s a complete fabricated malicious allegation and I don t know what the motive is behind that What s criminal about training with a small group of riders We were the Tour de France team we would go and train at altitude Most teams do that they still do that today, It s seven years ago That was the treatment at that time prescribed for that in so they were the rules at the time that you were permitted to take that drug and I was granted permission to do that by the governing bodies at that time, It s easy to think with everything that has happened now to sit here and go yeah I regret it It s happened I can t turn the clock back, Well had I had an asthma attack no probably not No, never throughout my career no I worked and had the passion I have had for this sport for years You ve got jerseys I am writing a book I have been writing a book in here all morning about the love of the sport To do that to the sport It s just absurd, These allegations it s the worst thing to be accused of I have said that before but it is also the hardest thing to prove you haven t done We are not dealing within a legal system I would have more rights if I had murdered someone in this process, I have been gagged for the last months because there was a legal investigation going on I couldn t say anything Then I was still waiting on this DCMS report These allegations have never been put to me before now I have only found out today what I am actually being accused of, The whole jiffy bag thing was just a shambles, God knows your guess was as good as mine, Dan let me tell you something I was doing the Dauphine I was leading the Dauphine I won the Dauphine The first time I became aware of a package was when the Daily Mail contacted me in October, But the way it has been reported is as if I have ordered this package and I am waiting for DHL to deliver it for me and I have got to sign for it thanks for the medical package I don t run the team I don t run the logistics of the team I was busy doing my job that I was paid to do, The innuendo of that allegation was that there was an injection done in the back of the bus in front of other people that no one else mysteriously didn t see We would have been breaking the rules had we done that, No Absolutely not We travelled six hours later on a training camp to Sestiere at high altitude and I was treated that night when the doctor came with Fluimucil with a nebuliser That story would have had no weight had an anonymous source not come along and said I saw Brad being injected on the back of the bus we ve got a story on our hands, At that point I can t comment on it because it s under investigation Ukad told me in September I had a meeting with them they opened the investigation on the back of the Daily Mail article with regards to the package, Now once that investigation got opened I am gagged for legal reasons until I have acted as a witness I have given them all the information I have told them all this, In Sestriere out of competition not on the bus Because we are still tidying up I was doing podium I was doing press I was doing dope control I had just won the race, We were going to a training camp then in Sestriere for one week after that which we all travelled to from La Toussuire to Sestriere a three hour drive two and a half hour drive whatever it is The doctor came with us to Sestriere to then treat the riders whatever they needed any niggles, Doctor Freeman, I haven t been able to say anything because there was an investigation going on based on that package and the Daily Mail article that was written about that package, So Ukad opened the investigation based on the back of that Daily Mail article Matt Lawton asked me those questions before he wrote the article and I said exactly what I said to you I knew nothing about the package until you have now told me it I didn t know the contents of it I didn t even know there was a package until I was asked about it, Then obviously since that investigation was opened which took months to conclude I couldn t Not wanting to jeopardise the investigation that was going on, I don t know your guess is as good as mine I didn t even know if there was a package It s become such a I just don t know a furore and a mess and obviously what didn t help was all the things that came with the start of that package People trying to you know pouring petrol on it someone was supposed to be somewhere else someone was supposed to be here, No of course it doesn t It s ludicrous, Not on me At the end of the day the buck stops with me I am the athlete here I have just won the biggest pre Tour race I am not going to break the rules by injecting when two weeks later I had a piece of paper to say I could do it legally, So no rules were broken, Not at that point No, Yeah it was granted until, It was seven days six days before the Tour de France Had I had that injection when the innuendo was that I did I won the National Road Race a week later it would have shown in my urine at the National Road Race I got tested there So I would have been breaking the rules and tested positive, That evening The same evening the day the race finished We then drove to Sestriere Dr Freeman came to Sestriere we were all then treated then Everyone is scrambling around at the end of races getting their bags suitcases people are going different directions, I don t know I can only go on what I have been told Apparently it was for me I don t know Could have been for anyone but apparently it was for me, The anonymous source said it was for me so I don t know I can only tell you if it did have Triamcinolone in it it didn t go in my backside Which is what is being suggested because it would have shown in my urine at the National Road Race, Yes Once I had the certification from Wada and the UCI that I was able to take it it was then taken and administered, God knows Maybe it was the lack of records who knows I am obviously following that whole scenario from when it evolved and it was just snowballing and it was just one hiccup after another, I am the athlete and the rider and all I could control at that time was the medical records I had which were shown to Ukad presented to them and that s all I have got to go on I can t account for who took what where what was in it, They have admitted fault for that And if that s the worst thing they have done but all the speculation sensationalism that has come out of that has been way off, Of course and that all becomes fact a year ago I was on Soccer AM and I said hopefully I ll have my say soon a year on and I am just having my first say on it I can only control in this whole period this whole madness this mad pack outside waving pitchforks and that it s just all I could control was what I could control, I am trying to cooperate with Ukad I am then hoping they would wrap that up pretty quickly so I can move on with my life Here we are still in March of and this report has come out and it has left us in a worse position, We ve had a legal case already that has been wrapped up and now it s just put it out there and now I have got to deal with this There is nothing to substantiate it there is nothing to back it up These anonymous sources I mean it s ludicrous, Will we ever know who this source is Or the motivation behind it What do we do know Where do we go from here I am now going to do a series of interviews and just try and explain through this now piece by piece, No Let me clarify this That package as we have been told in the Houses of Parliament contained Fluimucil I had Fluimucil that night whether it came out of that package or not maybe it did if they were short of it and they needed more brought out then maybe yeah I was on Fluimucil that whole week With the problems I had with pollen and allergies I had mucus on my chest blocked nose and everything and I was using that through a nebuliser to break down the mucus to get the phlegm off my chest, Whether it had anything else in the package I don t know Only a select few people will know exactly what was in that package I don t know I didn t order it it wasn t delivered to me as reported, So I am just what I have seen in the press or in the Houses of Parliament I can t categorically say yes it did have this I don t know I know what I was treated with and I know what I did and didn t do at the end of that race, As I told the Ukad investigation this whole thing about being treated at the back of the bus someone s supposedly saw it well what about the other riders on the bus that were all getting showered and changed and getting their suitcases ready It s just complete fabrication and malicious as well, It s a deliberate malicious allegation to create this and now we re having to prove the negative which is almost impossible, A lot of this could have been solved very early on with clear records clear record keeping this that and the other I m not in control of that I m doing my job as best as I can I m doing what s asked of me logging training putting it on an internet page for people to see it everything else around me the transportation of medical products or this that and the other I m not sat there thinking I ll ask the question of this ensure that everyone s doing their job, I think it s just a sign of the times as well back in the initial thing of this package year two of Team Sky just carnage disorganisation in the sense that British Cycling employees coming over with this that and the other and being in the velodrome, Well no it doesn t, I don t think it is now I think this is a well oiled ship now from what I understand I don t know I haven t been in the team for three years I went to a thing in Nice last year with Rapha and the ex team chef was there Henrik talking in a Q and A he was saying now there s a WhatsApp group and they have to see what s left on the table after they ve cooked a meal and there s this much rice and this much pasta and they can work out from that how much carbs everyone s had or they haven t had, The first thing I said is it s a shame they couldn t keep a bloody record of what was in this package that went out because if they would ve we wouldn t be here now, From the package point of view there wouldn t have been an investigation there wouldn t have been a Daily Mail article we would have been able to just nip it in the bud earlier, I don t know that is what really worries me at the moment It s the motive behind this the timing of it the timing of a lot of other things that were happening in British Cycling and Team Sky at that time me coming to the end of my career, I m trying to be in retirement and do other things in my life Just the effect it s had the widespread effect it s had on the family It s just horrific I m having to pick up the pieces with the kids I m left to do that as well as try and salvage my reputation I wouldn t wish it on anyone, And I got criticised for saying that Why The effect it s had on my family that was a living hell I understand I have to answer the questions which I wasn t able to do up until that point but it s just that really, I wish I could sit here now and say I could show you this I could show you this I could show you this but obviously I can t do that I can only tell you what I know from that time on recall and it s what I told Ukad and I wasn t even given the opportunity to tell the parliamentary hearing, Let s substantiate show us the new evidence that you ve got because it s funny that this has never come to light before during a legal investigation when it could have done and we could have been sanctioned if that was the case if that was found it wasn t They cited lack of evidence in the Ukad inquiry so where s this come from And being able to remain anonymous, No it s not Ukad s fault Ukad were doing what they had to do, No I think it was computers going missing this that and the other that s not my fault that s out of my control isn t it, Well I still think that what he s done for the sport it will be a shame if he had to go when a lot of this is just it s a report based on rumour and anonymous sources and they ve already admitted fault for those years in terms of record keeping and stuff, I think once things are substantiated and if proven then maybe he should go but until that is we can t just take this report as set in concrete I mean this has now become fact that s it you know this is fact, It s been three years since this and that s all they can come up with It would have been nice to have been asked the question I would have loved to have been asked the question, This allegation has been made through new evidence that has come to light have you got any response to this Bradley I would have loved to have been asked the question given the opportunity to respond to it, I got five wishy washy questions about packages and other stuff that I knew nothing about I mean these are serious allegations that have a large impact on someone s life I should at least be given a fair trial and an opportunity to be able to answer them, Not by the report no I got an th hour email last week We d like to give you five questions to answer, No, Well I think they re going through a process at the moment I think they should be at least allowed to go through that process, Normally people get the opportunity to go through that without that being in the public domain So I think the least they deserve is being able to go through this process because again that s not a nice thing to be accused of, I don t know enough medically whether that is a natural thing that can occur in your body or not so I think they can at least allow an opportunity to present their findings That s what this country is famous for its justice system and being able to do that, Yeah but I think I m always dubious of people in those positions I sat with you in in a Sky training camp talking about Lance Armstrong there s messages that you re being told, I d love to talk freely as I ve been able to talk today and I think under the landscape of that time as the Tour de France winner I don t think I really felt that I spoke my mind, I always question what people say especially under the current landscape in cycling because a lot of the time I think people just tell you what they think the journalist wants to hear because they don t want the hassle I just want to get on with the job tomorrow of racing this race, Well it remains to be seen doesn t it I ve now got a road of trying to have my say and be able to explain at least my side One of the biggest things was not being able to speak the last year or year and a half and in doing that you leave people to write their own stories, I want to put this thing to bed and I ll do more interviews this week if I have to I ve got nothing to hide this is about me now being able to have my say and let people decide for themselves by actually bringing a bit of balance back to this whole thing, At the moment it s been so weighted and one sided and I just think this needs a bit of balance and perspective This report today is a political report based on rumour and there s nothing to substantiate it Who are these sources Come out If you really feel that deep about it that you ve got to go and tell the Houses of Parliament about it then go on record put your name to it because it will validate it Where s the evidence Show the evidence because this is serious stuff, Well apparently it would be according to the people that have commented on it It s a lovely poetic story that ties in with this whole situation we ve been in for the last months of lost records people trying to put stories down or make them disappear or this that and the other, It makes a lovely story but the reality is quite different What if we didn t What if it was all legitimate and there was medical need and we followed all the right protocols and we went to the specialist that would produce it we went to the UCI They were the rules at the time, As the athlete there was no playing of the system I was doing my job as a professional in the sport that I love and continue to love and will continue to love until my dying days It s not a sport that I would have abused or risked putting myself at jeopardy I have every pride in what I achieved on my bike and continue to I still have the jersey and the bike helmet hanging up at home, I don t think oh god I wish I d never done that I stand by it no rules were ever broken I certainly didn t play the system and I didn t cheat the system throughout my career This wasn t something I did on a yearly basis whatever the target whether it s the Paris Roubaix the hour record or the Olympic team pursuit this was at the time, Who s he, For every Professor Lipworth there s another doctor who will say the opposite to that I ve had people contacting me throughout this whole process saying this is ludicrous and this is bonkers, There s been a deliberate use of the language powerful steroid it s not a powerful steroid these doctors are telling me it s an anti inflammatory drug and that it s not even ranked in the top five of steroids Prednisolone is much higher used for bee stings chest infections etc, There s been a deliberate choice of language on these things You have to be hospitalised You re talking about elite athletes that are competing in the high mountains and trying to be and bring yourself back to a level playing field when you ve got asthma problems or suffering from allergies, What can I say to that, No I can t, That s the key intention Whether there was or wasn t I don t know I can t sit here and say that, I d won every bike race up to that point I d won every time trial that season and I continued that pattern through the Tour de France It wasn t me coming out of the blue this was me on an month progression working towards this objective, Intention that s the key to it Was there a performance enhancement You tell me there was There may well have been yeah but they were the rules at the time to treat this problem That s what I was prescribed I can t change the last five years, I don t feel let down by what I was advised to do at that time I ve been let down since in terms of the last months what s happened with packages and the outcome of this report based on anonymous sources, The least I deserve is some hard evidence If that s the accusation well where s the evidence to support that Come on let s put it out there Because I m left here now That s the end of it report s over you pick the pieces up Jack get on with it And I ve got to now do that, Yeah but he didn t say that at the Houses of Parliament in December did he, But why I don t know what his motivation is for that I haven t spoken to him for a year, They were the rules at the time they said I could take it It was under their rules at the time They went to their panel whether I could be granted this TUE, But they are going to look at this report and see in black and white that these MPs clearly believe that these TUEs were taken for gains, They can only go on the specialist report I was given I had things prodded up my nose and what can I say they were their rules at the time and that was the application If they didn t feel it was they could have denied the application, No I used tramadol I used it in training sometimes It wasn t like it was described You were allowed to use it at that time and it wasn t being dished out on the bus, Things like that is where it blurs people are coming from all angles We re talking about one thing and someone will throw something else into the ring It just adds weight to this whole kind of thing The things that were going around at a certain period are just wild and way off the mark and completely out of context, I ve not been able to get my head round some things I was asked certain questions by a certain journalist for a certain newspaper about certain things and back in the end of I was asked whether I d missed a test or not And I freely volunteered the information and said I d never missed a test in all the years of whereabouts I ve never missed a test, I had a filing failure I didn t even have a strike I had a filing failure for not putting the right details in on a long haul flight from California back in And that was just lack of information I was on a long haul flight I didn t have a test miss a test or anything like that, The story that came out from that information was Wiggins in missed test blunder just three months before What equates to a missed test doping blunder I mean just that that choice of language How do you get a story like that from that, And Wiggins shuns Olympic parade I haven t been to an Olympic parade since I don t do them I don t like the adulation on stage with everyone else And it was just constant story after story after story let s see how much more we can add, And that to me adds as much weight to this whole package thing to discredit him at any opportunity That s a witch hunt because there s nothing to substantiate that And there s an investigation on so obviously I can t speak as well so it s just week after week after week, That s the sport that we re in It s the most scrutinised sport in the world, I can t control that what people are going to think or not think All I can tell you is from my point of view what I experienced and I m not in control of what people are going to make of it, You ve also got to remember that some people whatever you re going to do is never going to be good enough I just don t know anymore in this sport You re damned if you do and you re damned if you don t, Yeah constantly It s all that matters really in this I ll get a flogging I don t mind getting a flogging if it ll help me I ll go back to Henry VIII times and stick my head in one of those things and get people to flog me but it s the kids, What s reported people see what s reported and they get a hammering at school and it s disgusting It s disgusting to witness it and what do you do about it This has been going on for such a long time now Just look at the papers today they say one thing but that s not exactly it, I would have liked a better process because that s it now That report that s fact now They ll move on to something else now this bunch of MPs and it would have been nice to comment on the allegations, Share this with, Find out more, Top Stories, Related to this story, Also in

university level educational worldwide is today announcing a significant new investment million in Series B funding in a round led by top VC firm Also participating in the round were Udacity s previous investors and, To date the company has raised million in outside funding for its platform which offers online courses in Computer Science Mathematics General Sciences Programming and Entrepreneurship to students who may not have the time money access or inclination to study in a traditional university setting, As a part of the funding Andreessen Horowitz general partner Peter Levine is joining board Levine has on why the firm chose to invest in Udacity and it s an article worth reading in its entirety But to sum it up the firm believes in this concept of which means that more and more businesses and industries are being run on software from agriculture to education and the firm is backing those it thinks has the most potential to disrupt the established ways of doing things In Udacity s case they re disrupting the idea that access to higher education is something which can only be found through the traditional university system Says Levine of startup it s a team and company that we re absolutely convinced will change the world, Although there are now numerous startups attempting to disrupt higher learning Khan Academy tor ShowMe Udemy Grockit Coursera Lynda and StraighterLine come to mind the investment from Andreessen Horowitz now makes Udacity one to watch in terms of becoming a profitable business Although classes at Udacity are free students can optionally take certified exams which have some cost to them and the startup is beginning to place graduates in full time positions which helps Udacity earn referral fees, Udacity plans on using the new funding to continue to build its technology platform which will include mobile applications and the introduction of adaptive learning techniques which will change based on students capabilities They will also scale up in terms of classes offered and work more with those in related industries on graduate referrals, Co founder who started the company with fellow roboticists and is also well known as the co inventor of Google s self driving car He s someone who goes after the bigger and tougher problems of our times a mindset shared by his Google colleagues Working with people at Google most notably Google founders Sergey and Larry I ve learned that you can spend your time tackling small problems or big problems and you end up spending the same amount of time for either one Thrun explains so you might as well spend your time solving big problems, Prior to founding Udacity Thrun was also a Stanford professor teaching classes on artificial intelligence After seeing the impact that Sal Khan s was having on education Khan s classes reach hundreds of millions of students around the world Thrun was motivated to do the same with his class The initial way we announced it was really chaotic we just sent out an email that said you can take our class for free online he says speaking of the spark which eventually became the online educational platform that s today s Udacity That first night students signed up When the class reached students Stanford asked them to shut down enrollment They couldn t fathom what was happening Thrun said He decided to leave the university and launch Udacity, Udacity unlike some other attempts at democratizing higher ed does not just offer webcam recordings of lectures Instead Thrun describes Udacity s classes as being almost like a game Students are bombarded with questions and puzzles and quizzes rather than lectures he says We shunned the lecture entirely In Udacity s classes students are actively problem solving after a professor introduces the topic briefly We believe that learning by doing is more important than learning by listening Thrun explains This model similar to that of the flipped classroom is what some are betting on as the future of education It s essentially an argument that book learning is an outmoded and ineffective way to impart true knowledge, Udacity s platform is more than videos It has its own learning management system a built in programming interface for solving coding challenges and a discussion forum and social element modeled after Facebook Today it offers classes but with the new funding that number will grow In addition instructors and funding including Google Microsoft Autodesk Nvidia Cadence and Wolfram Alpha These classes will start in January, The startup now has over students signed up to take courses and the company is beginning to work with others in the industry to help place those students in jobs To date Udacity graduates have found employment this way, However when expanding outside of the Silicon Valley tech industry as Udacity plans to do with courses that could range from biotechnology to pharmaceutical training for example a question is raised can virtual learning ever the in person learning environment especially when students need to do work in a lab setting To this end Udacity is already experimenting with partially physical and partially virtual classes says Thrun But so far the topic at hand has been entrepreneurship something that doesn t necessitate access to things like chemicals or microscopes or equipment That being said if employers themselves are starting to get involved with the training of potential hires through Udacity it s likely that they may consider going the extra mile to host students on site in the future, That leaves the other big if will the world s employers really value a Udacity degree the way they value a traditional university degree It remains to be seen says Thrun I think that s going to be a phase shift that s going to take some time But with the new funding Udacity has more time to make that shift happen]}}

thought nothing of it only to wake up the next day and BOOM, Within hours you are the proud owner of a Galia melon sized bruise, The nature of the beast means snow and ice related knocks can be bigger and much more painful than land based ouchies, Some in depth research has concluded speed gravity fearlessness and throwing yourself off mountains are all contributing factors, Team GB s Aimee Fuller picked up some rather nasty looking scrapes having in Monday s Big Air qualifiers in Pyeongchang, Media playback is not supported on this device, We have taken a look at some of the horrible bumps and

even began, First a minor fracture to her wrist meant she planned to compete with a splint but the following day lightning struck twice, It was the first run of the day I was on the same rail as where she picked up the wrist injury, I just came off a bit early and dropped maybe two or three metres on to the flat It was almost like landing on concrete and my heel broke into two pieces, I remember saying to my coach that I was too scared to take my boot off as I thought it would be bleeding I thought it would be a compound fracture that s how painful it was, Ouch Ouch Ouch, Since then we have learned she has undergone successful surgery and is back in the UK having further treatment, Shaun White, The Flying Tomato s journey to the Winter Olympics was a rather bloody one, Olympic snowboard

picks compare to other cards on the market, Related Posts, We use CapitalOne Venture Love love that card We travel to Europe a lot no transaction fee ever They are very prompt when I turn in my rewards within a day or two credited to our account, Cap one was our card of choice for travel but the way they redeem travel charges sometimes is not to ones benefits For example if one charges a flight for they deduct points there are levels of reward paybacks and often they rip you off by charging a higher level of rewards points than the actual cost Bank of America rewards poits equal the plane or hotel price and give one and one half points per dollar spent and chards no annual fee, I have cards with Capital One I am Percent satisfied with their service and terms Had to call on a couple of occasions and found out how helpful their agents are I highly recommend Capital One, I presently have a Chase visa that is linked to United Miles Explorer I have many auto bill payment accounts for my expenses and use the card for a fair amount of air travel and have accumulated air travel points Is it worth my time and should I consider moving the card into the Chase Sapphire Preferred I have excellent credit, We have used Capital One Venture cars as our primary card for several years back on everything and an annual Fee per year We pay EVERY purchase by credit card even a cup of coffee at Starbucks so the adds up quickly Of course to stay ahead you have to pay off that balance every month Repeating bills like electric phone etc we charge on another card because Capital One changed our card twice in the last years they never verified this but we think they might have been hacked This hasn t happened for over a year so seems to be ok now Courteous professional customer service and they send us a check on a designated day every year Great card, Bank Americard Cash Rewards is the very best credit card available, I am surprised the CapitalOne Venture card has not been mentioned We get back on all our purchased applied to any travel expenses past or present or miles credit Although there is an annual fee the staff at Capital One are always professional pleasant and never hesitate to call us when they discover fraudulent activity They have also gone to bat for us when we ve been unfairly charged by a retailer Love CapitalOne, A question if Tasha Lockyer is reading comments and replying What is the best card for world traveling if your company is paying for the flights and some expenses A card that is accepted in most of Asia Africa Europe and South America So basically anywhere Thanks, Best credit card for me is one where I earn a high cashback no interest and no annual fee I couldn t care less how high the interest rate is because I m never going to carry a balance If I don t have the money to pay cash for something I don t buy it simple, Citi Double Cash back is my primary card but it has several weaknesses they are extremely slow with crediting accounts and they only pay out in increments In other words you have to spend and pay back to get your back Then you get nothing until you have spent and paid back another Of course you could settle for the cash back without paying off your balance but the interest rates on the card is higher than average If you carry a balance you are going to be loosing money big time, Capitol One Quicksilver and Chase Freedom Unlimited pay and they don t play games like Citi I m left wondering if the extra is worth the hassle Citi puts you through about per spent and paid back, CitiCard offers cash back on everything you purchase with no exceptions It has no annual fee, chase ink the best, I find it amazing the Capital One Venture card is not on here Although there is an annual fee you general back on ALL purchases and when I got it months ago it had a signing bonus equal to I believe It was high I also have an AmEx Blue Sky rewards preferred which was pretty great with the included in flight credit as well as cash back, I ve had a Discover Card since but almost never used it because the interest rate was around I have another card so it s a no brainer My FICO score is always good between I called Discover with this information to have them lower my interest rate They did but only by pts Long story shorter it s taken calls over a period of yrs to get where I am now

Manchester City, Does ever qualify as a thrashing It does now City were utterly dominant the bosses of Everton from the get go They were sensational with David Silva and Leroy Sane particularly shining But to a man they were magnificent shouldn t self flagellate too much because City can win the title against Manchester United next weekend A penny for the thoughts of Jose Mourinho who will have been furiously taking notes while watching this masterclass Repeat that last sentence for Jurgen Klopp whose team have quite the Champions League poser in midweek Wow, Updated, Sane tries to dribble upfield from his own goalline He s very nearly dispossessed and embarrassed by Niasse A bit over confident despite all his brilliance Anyway he gets away with it There will be three added minutes have been dreaming of this moment for the last hour and a half, Fernandinho tries to Rooney one in from the halfway line It s off target while Pickford had spotted the danger anyway and would have got back in time, Danilo comes on for Laporte, Good running by Walker down the right but the corner he earns comes to nothing, Everton finally string a few passes together This is much better Eventually Walcott flings in a cross from the right Niasse throws himself at it and flashes a spectacular header goalward Ederson reads it well though and the striker s offside anyway Thing is it s not as though haven t asked any questions of City at all You do wonder if they could have been a little more proactive certainly since Bolasie pulled one back Because in football you never know, More City passing, Keane launches long Walcott tries to flick a header on for Coleman out on the right but the ball flies out for a goal kick The comparison between Sterling and Walcott in this match isn t particularly encouraging for Walcott suggests Charles Antaki It s true that he s seen almost nothing of the ball and I know that this is a parochial interest but Arsenal fans will note with sympathetic acknowledgement that trees remain rooted at his new club, Tosun whose last act was to grapple with Kompany in a futile battle to make ground in the City half is replaced by Niasse, De Bruyne is replaced by Gundogan Some bench City have huh, City have enjoyed possession in the last five minutes As good as they have been they ve been helped by sitting back The home side have made little attempt to search for a second that might get the visitors thinking, Fernandinho tries to curl one into the top left He s inches away Pickford wouldn t have got there And then Calvert Lewin is replaced by Baningime, Updated, City continue to stroke it around the middle The clock ticks on This is a very measured grown up response to conceding that goal No panic whatsoever, Walker and Jesus play a long range one two down the right It s close to opening up Not quite, Fernandinho dribbles down the middle and suddenly the defence opens up in the Red Sea style He should enter the area and bang a shot on goal but loses his nerve and flicks to the left for Sane Or was the pass meant for David Silva Either way it s a dreadful ball and it whistles out of play for a goal kick, City cleverly take the sting out of the game with some ball hogging in the middle of the park They re going nowhere but that s not the point This is smart game management and Goodison has lost a little of its recently rediscovered roar already, Kompany clanks the ball out of play down the right for a corner for Everton That was totally unnecessary City can t be nervous after all this can they Well maybe The corner s hit long and Tosun slams a header wide left from close range He should have done better Thing is if score another well it s something everyone in Goodison has worked out because there s quite a noise in the old place now, City respond by replacing Sterling with Bernardo Silva, GOAL Everton Manchester City Bolasie, Out of nothing and against the run of play score Bolasie takes up possession to the left of the City D and decides to buy a raffle ticket He hammers a low shot through Walker s legs off the base of the left hand post across the face of the goal and into the other corner Just the two goals in it all of a sudden, Updated, Sterling threatens to break down the inside left channel but Keane does very well to stay strong and hold him off, Sane and Sterling combine down the left Sterling s low cross isn t anticipated by anyone in purple City recycle possession Fernandinho chips down the right to release Jesus into the box The flag goes up for offside though that was very tight Jesus s attempt to squirt the ball past Pickford and into the bottom left from a narrow angle flies across the face of goal anyway, Tosun goes racing after a slack Walker pass down the left A chance to cause City some bother but he hesitates and allows Otamendi to pick his pocket, Rooney who has been anonymous except when fuming is replaced by Davies, Ferdandinho has a dig from yards The shot takes a big deflection and Pickford does very well to change direction and ensure the ball doesn t nestle into the bottom right That s a fine reaction save, De Bruyne spreads a glorious pass down the right for Walker who pulls back from the byline for Jesus Once again the striker can t quite get on the end of it We re talking inches every time though, Updated, City continue to attack Everton from all angles Silva lobs a ball up for Sane near the left hand post Sane heads down but can t quite tee up Jesus Then Walker has a romp down the right His low cross is knocked behind by Jagielka just before Jesus can get there The corner comes to nothing but Silva is soon conducting once again very nearly finding Jesus with a cute flick through the middle It s relentless, City restore the old order with some more metronomic passing in the middle, This could be quite an interesting half of football Everton are clearly trying to restore some pride going at it too hard though might result in further pain Tosun bustles to earn a corner down the right But from it City threaten to break clear upfield Jesus looks like departing into the half at speed Jagielka makes what was in effect a last man tackle yards from his own goal, Jesus out on the left tries to slip a pass inside which would have released Sane on goal His pass hits Jagielka s heel breathe again, City spend the first couple of minutes of the second half hogging the ball again Goodison is very quiet right now, City who enjoyed of possession in the first half restart the party Everton made passes No changes, That will have been a long minutes for fans And on that subject, When extra time had no end how one match lasted hrs and mins, HALF TIME Everton Manchester City, A few boos around Goodison but can t beat themselves up about this City are going to be crowned champions of England very soon and they ve been simply sensational Nobody could live with this, Fernandinho attempts to float a chip down the inside left to release Silva The pass is just a little bit too strong Silva was inches away from being clear on goal, More bedlam in the Everton box Laporte nearly setting up Jesus near the right hand post really need to hear the half time whistle Tell the truth they really need to hear the full time whistle it s been one of those days for them so far, The corner s hit long Laporte tries to recycle possession near the right hand corner flag Pickford races out of his area to blooter clear He s nudged over by Laporte and springs up He offers Laporte a square go A slight over reaction given there was little in the challenge which came at the end of a fair footrace But will be collectively fuming at present so it s understandable if not strictly legal The linesman steps in to calm everything down]}}

redemptive a happy ending of sorts a way of making Russia s World Cup beautiful, Contact author, see a bad moon rising I see trouble on the way Or if not quite trouble then some interesting times this summer for the poor old beleaguered World Cup and indeed for in what is surely a last realistic shot at the ultimate prize for the most exhilarating footballer of the modern age, Argentina s travelling fans are still among the most vivid memories of the last tournament in Brazil a sweaty gleeful Messi worshipping horde from across the border that in the last few days before the final seemed to be coming up through the Rio drains and falling down from the trees emerging in ever greater numbers from the Copacabana surf, Ramshackle Argentina show they need Lionel Messi more than ever Marcela Mora y Araujo, By the end they were sleeping in cars in the Rio side streets packing out the bars and parading in the main streets and all the while singing that song to the tune of Bad Moon Rising that ends with the line You re going to see Messi he ll bring us back the cup Except of course it didn t happen like that And it seems even less likely to happen this time around given on Wednesday, In mitigation Spain were sensationally good in Madrid Plus of course Messi didn t play watching instead from the stands and looking as mournfully blank as he had four years ago wandering off the Maraca a pitch past a huge screen proclaiming him the player of the tournament, And really it is the sense of heaviness that is striking here The is like a revolver to his head the manager Jorge Sampaoli had said even before the evisceration by Spain referring to Messi having to carry both his team and his own elite sporting destiny, But his words chimed uneasily with the wider weather fronts of Russia a tournament that has become ever more grey and ominous from the relentless politicking on all sides to the bad moon that hangs over every Fifa event an ugliness spawned in the Sepp Blatter end times that must now play itself out over four more years of curdled power play, Against this backdrop the idea that Messi now and who has done nothing but bring sporting joy might get another shot at winning a World Cup has felt like a glimmer of something redemptive a happy ending of sorts a way of making this tournament beautiful, Even this is complicated however It would be fair to suggest at this point there is nothing particularly subversive or novel about the world s most famous multimillionaire footballer illuminating Vladimir Putin s circus Better from this perspective for France to go and win it after Tuesday s or for some perennially menaced Baltic state to make a late entrance and thrash the host nation in the semis, But this is where Messi himself becomes interesting where glory at this World Cup might also add another layer or at least some actual substance to the basic meaning of Lionel, Let s face it away from the on field feats the most interesting thing about Messi is how startlingly uninteresting he is the peculiar remoteness of his public persona Has any near ubiquitous public face ever had so little content so little depth He seems nice But Messi really does have nothing to declare but his own genius no context beyond that endlessly gushing well of brilliance, This is not meant as a criticism There is no extra obligation for sports people to intersect with the wider world But usually great athletes just can t help being political beings Diego Maradona got to mean something simply by being poor and brilliant and flawed the charismatic outsider with shades of darkness and light Even Pel who seemed to have spent most of the s travelling the world in a fur lined helicopter wearing a solid gold hat had a depth of meaning to his feats a kid from Bauru who emerged from poverty to conquer the sporting world, And then we have Messi For a while his defiantly ordinary demeanour felt like it might carry some significance a kind of holy fool dynamic The best player in the world didn t have tattoos and a douchebag hairstyle Then he got tattoos and a douchebag hairstyle So that was that At the end of which the meaning of Messi is simply that being really good at football is really good Being the best is the best Have a good time all the time, Except of course there is something else here The joy As Sampaoli also said in Madrid Messi needs to be able to enjoy football to relax to exist as a free spirit to become his most exhilarating self And this is perhaps Messi s wider significance a reminder that playfulness and joy are the essence of what he does that he succeeds by communicating this basic sense of freedom of something upliftingly impish, This enduring spark is the most striking thing about his years of success in the most managed of footballing worlds a place of corporate lockdown and annihilating physicality In the middle of this hiding in plain sight Messi is the opposite of control an antidote to grey, It isn t so far fetched he could do it in Russia too very rarely lose with him in the team Messi himself looks fitter than four years ago and more at ease an oddly gentle supercharged sporting genius who is still and for all the gongs and glories an element of grace within the machine]}}

external links and will open in a new window, In the commemorations of World War One there have been many stories from the descendants of those caught up in momentous and awful events, These personal accounts remembering the faces in grainy photographs and names on headstones are usually of ordinary soldiers who fought in the trenches, But a ceremony in London this week brought together descendants of two of the most iconic commanders from the war the decision makers whose orders sent millions into battle, This latest war commemorations mark the point years ago when a French marshal Ferdinand Foch was made supreme allied commander on the Western Front, His great grandson Eric Becourt Foch was at the ceremony along with Lord Astor grandson of one of most famous figures of the war Field Marshal Douglas Haig, The ancestors of these two men sent colossal armies into battle with casualties on a scale not seen before or since They literally had the fates of millions of lives in their hands, Were they distant from the suffering of the front line soldiers, Mr Becourt Foch said his great grandfather had his own share of sacrifice and their family has never been sheltered from the loss of war, Within the first month of the war his only son had died in battle On the same day in August his son in law Mr Becourt Foch s grandfather was also killed, His grandson Mr Becourt Foch s father fought and died with the Free French in North Africa in World War Two, It cannot be a good thing But we were attacked by the Germans we had to defend ourselves he said, The ceremony in London was held at the statue of Marshal Foch near to Victoria Station and marked the stage in the war in when the Western allies switched to a single co ordinated command to take on the Germans, Mr Becourt Foch says that when his great grandfather went to receive the baton of field marshal from King George V the conversation was in French Foch now in charge of British forces spoke little English but King George V was able to speak French, They knew that the Germans would try to divide the allies strategically and militarily so Mr Becourt Foch says his great grandfather had to keep British and French forces together whatever it costs, The connection continued after the war Marshal Foch was a pall bearer at the funeral of Field Marshal Haig in, His grandson Lord Astor says there was a strong mutual respect between the two commanders He cried all the way through the funeral, Haig s reputation has been under constant revision following the historical cycle of being revered reviled and then rehabilitated, His name became associated with the terrible casualties of battles such as the Somme, I accept mistakes were made but they learned from their mistakes and they built on them and we won the war in the end said Lord Astor, We defeated the most powerful army in the world the German army and we should record that with pride, A lot of the focus has been on the problems Passchendaele and the Somme but we also should focus on the victories, He defends his grandfather s approach to the war as he commanded an army of two million men, He was accused of not being defensive enough but what was the alternative to sit in the trenches You had to try and break out somewhere, The posthumous criticism of Haig hurt his family, My mother was very affected she was only eight when her father died and she was shaken by some of the stories about him, But by the time she d died a lot of that had changed he said, Lord Astor says his grandfather was highly respected by his soldiers and later criticism failed to recognise how much he was admired at the time, He was revered in his lifetime When he died there were two million people on the streets of London, The soldiers who had served under him lined the routes of his funeral he says, They wouldn t have done that if he was unpopular adds Lord Astor, The ceremony in London marked the point when a common leadership was needed by the Western allies with Foch s appointment backed by Haig, Both Mr Becourt Foch and Lord Astor emphasise the need to maintain the partnership between British and French military forces, But now says Mr Becourt Foch there is also strong reconciliation with Germany, And while diplomatically stepping around the Brexit debate he says the era after World War Two has helped to build European unity, The two families names remain synonymous with World War One, The Haig Fund used to be printed on remembrance poppies In towns and villages across France there are thousands of streets named after Foch, As the commemorations approach for the last stages of the war Lord Astor says I think my main reason for remembering is for all the dead there were very few families that didn t lose a member, Related

Spring in Tashkent Is Uzbekistan really opening up, Share this with, Email, Facebook, Messenger, Messenger, Twitter, Pinterest, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Copy this link, These are external links and will open in a new window, Uzbekistan is a country that has long been in the shadows but this week the once repressive and secretive Central Asian state invited the media in for an international summit on the peace process in Afghanistan It was a chance for BBC Uzbek s Ibrat Safo to return home for the first time in more than years, Spring always comes suddenly in Tashkent, One day it s cold and grey the next the city s almond and apricot trees burst into blossom, This year the streets are also festooned with fairy lights to celebrate Navruz the tradition spring festival, Even in the pouring rain there s a new sense of hope and anticipation in the air, After the death President Islam Karimov in Uzbekistan has started to open up, And this week s Afghan peace conference with delegates and journalists flying in from all over the world was the highest profile indication yet of a new willingness to re engage with the world, Returning home, For me it was a chance to return home to work for the first time since the BBC had to leave Uzbekistan in the aftermath of the unrest and violence in the town of Andijan in, And I wasn t the only one As I walked into the grand white marble conference media centre I met many familiar faces from the old Tashkent press corps also returning for the first time in many years, The peace conference was headline news on all the local TV news programmes and everyone seemed to know about it, You here for the Afghan summit a taxi driver surprised me by asking on the first day, Like many people here he saw the conference as yet another sign that the new President Shavkat Mirziyoyev is trying do things differently, A peace summit makes sense for people here because neighbouring Afghanistan is not just a security nightmare right on their doorstep it s also a potentially huge market for Uzbek goods and services, In this country of million people where the economy has been stagnating for decades everyone is hoping for some better news, I work in a factory assembling washing machines my taxi driver told me Our products are more expensive now because Mirziyoyev slapped tariffs on Chinese spare parts, So that s bad for you then I asked, Oh no he replied We need to start making our own spare parts I think the president is totally doing the right thing, It was first of many similar conversations in the brief few days I was reporting in Tashkent which gave me a sense that things really are beginning to change, A more open media, Chatting to local reporters as we waited for the latest news from the conference floor I heard many stories about the way the media is opening up, State television news once famous for ignoring and headlining bulletins with stories about cement factories has suddenly become lively and interesting, Journalists are competitive covering real stories that matter to ordinary people life in a village with no electricity a teacher killed sweeping the roads for the local council, Of course there are still limits to this new freedom One reporter told me she was made to take down an online article after she criticised a monopoly business owned by a local official, And while people are keen to praise the new president there s still a reluctance to say anything too critical about his predecessor whose rule over more than two decades was marred by allegations of corruption and human rights abuses, In a brief break between sessions I went to visit a relative in hospital, On the wall there were framed portraits of both the old and new presidents They re still not ready to put that one in the bin one patient muttered darkly gesturing at Mr Karimov, At the peace conference the new and more open Uzbekistan was very much in evidence, The presidents of both Uzbekistan and Afghanistan attended the session as did the EU s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and senior officials from the United Nations and the countries taking part including the US and the UK, Sodyk Safoyev a former foreign minister and now deputy head of the Uzbek Senate told the BBC the conference was happening because of what he called Uzbekistan s renewed foreign policy over the past year and a half, A completely new political atmosphere has been created in Central Asia he said There s mutual trust and mutual readiness to resolve the most sensitive issues in the region, No one was expecting the peace conference to deliver any breakthroughs But that was never the point This was a chance for Uzbekistan to reclaim its place on the international stage and to show solidarity for a peace process that matters not just for Afghanistan but for all of Central Asia, It ended with a declaration supporting efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table and underlining that Afghans must lead the peace process themselves, As the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani s convoy swept through the streets on his way back to the airport like me he will have seen the wide avenues shiny shopping centres and grand apartment buildings of a new and very different Tashkent, Spring has come to Uzbekistan and I left hoping the new beginnings in my country might one day be echoed in a new day for peace in Afghanistan, Related

sprint and understand the responsibilities of each participant s role You ll participate in each step of the process to help this company solve their challenges and make actual contributions to the

designed to support focus on a particular area of learning Depending on your longer term goals a Foundations Nanodegree program enables you to sample new areas of learning enhance an existing skill set or prepare for a career move that requires a fuller understanding of certain technologies and concepts In the case of this program the Design Sprint is a creative problem solving tool and considered an additive skill that layers in a key competitive differentiator to your existing skill set, What jobs will this program prepare me for, As a Foundations Nanodegree program the focus of the curriculum is not job readiness The skills you learn can certainly be very valuable in your job and career but this program does not provide any career support or preparation, Will I receive a credential when I graduate as with other Nanodegree programs, Yes You will receive a Design Sprint Foundations Nanodegree program credential after you successfully complete the program, Enrollment, I enrolled today when will I have access to my program, The classroom opens monthly so the duration between when you enroll and when you start will vary depending on your enrollment date You can always find the next start date on the program s home page located, How long will I have access to the content, You will have access to the content for two months from the date your classroom opens Please note that you won t be able to access the content prior to the start of your term In the classroom you ll see a countdown to your term s start date, What are the prerequisites for enrollment, You should have basic computer skills and be comfortable navigating online You ll need to have access to a computer with file downloading capabilities It s also useful to have access to a camera to take photos for projects, Can I enroll in other Nanodegree programs while I m enrolled in the Design Sprint Foundations program, We do not recommend doing so though we do not prohibit concurrent enrollments To make the most of your experience we believe you are best served by focusing on one program at a time and being fully immersed in the unique structure and pacing You can always take one after the other, Program Structure, What is a Nanodegree Program, To read more about our Nanodegree program structure please refer to, Is this program online in person or some combination of both, The program is online and students interact with peers mentors coaches and instructors in our virtual classrooms in forums and on Slack, Due to the online nature of the Udacity Classroom will I need to be available online at specific times for my Design Sprint Foundations ND program, The Design Sprint Foundations content is available online globally in your Udacity classroom Program resources like Reviews and Student Services are also available online, Is this program self paced, It is not The Design Sprint Foundations Nanodegree program is a one month program that requires students to keep pace with their peers throughout the duration of the program If a student does not complete a term by the term deadline they will be removed from the program and will need to re enroll in a new term and pay the full term fee in order to continue, Will I be able to pause my Nanodegree program, No Due to the fixed term nature of the Design Sprint Foundations Nanodegree program and the need for maintaining a consistent and stable student body throughout it will not be possible to pause your enrollment in this program, How many hours a week should I expect to spend on my coursework in order to succeed, Between instructional content quizzes projects and other course related activity we estimate that investing hours week will enable you to proceed through the program at a successful pace, Will I have access to the material even after the term ends, As a Nanodegree program student you will retain access to the program materials for a period of time after graduation and you may download certain materials for your own records if you wish Please note however that students who leave the program or who are removed from the program for failure to meet the final deadline prior to successfully graduating will cease to have access, Deadline Policy, When we use the term deadline with regards to Nanodegree program projects we use it in one of two ways, It is very important to understand the distinctions between the two as your progress in the program is measured against the deadlines we ve established Please see below for an explanation of what each usage means, A final deadline for passing all projects, Passing a project in this context means that a Udacity Reviewer has marked your project as Meets Specifications In order to graduate you have to pass all projects by the last day of your content access, Ongoing suggested deadlines for individual projects, The deadlines you see in your classroom are suggestions for when you should ideally pass each project They are meant to help keep you on track so that you maintain an appropriate pace throughout the program and graduate on time, What happens if I don t complete a Nanodegree program project on time, It is strongly recommended that you complete each project on time to ensure you meet graduation requirements If you do not pass all the required Nanodegree program projects by the last day of your term you will lose access to the program and content See Deadline Policy above, What are my options if I don t complete the Nanodegree program by the end of the term, If you do not complete the term by the term deadline you will receive one free four week extension which will be automatically applied to your account If you do not complete the term within the extension period you will be removed from the program and will no longer be able to access course content To resume access to the course you would need to re enroll in a new term and pay the associated enrollment fees again Your progress will carry over and you ll be able to resume where you left off, Tuition, How much does the Nanodegree program cost, The Design Sprint Foundations Nanodegree program consists of one term that is one month long Students must complete the full month to earn their credential and graduate The term costs USD which is paid at the beginning of the term, Is there a free trial period for this program, There is no free trial period for the Design Sprint Foundations Nanodegree program, What is the refund policy, There is a day refund policy During this time you can visit the Settings page of your Udacity classroom where you can unenroll and request a full refund This day window begins the day the classroom opens After the first days course fees are non refundable, Are there scholarships available for

up lifts you up brings you life quite like pop music Even when it s or or or achingly belting their despair into that cold lonely night songs that make you feel all the feelings are still songs that are taking you to new heights There s nothing quite like a tune that hurts so good, As we wallow so do we celebrate, In South Korea the genre is known as K Pop a catchy moniker established in the s that s starting to catch fire around the globe and all the hallmarks of the superstars of the Western world are present and accounted for Charismatic boy bands polished pop princesses infectious chart topping singles carefully crafted images and tender aged men and women who ve inspired a level of fanaticism reserved for well almost no one besides pop stars these days, Music is the universal language after all, But for the second time in four months the K pop world is in mourning this time following the on March of singer He was, Photos, The actor and boyband heartthrob reportedly suffered cardiac arrest an official cause of death has not yet been announced, TOP Media founder the singer turned K pop impresario who s behind the groups and expressed his condolences in a calling Seo a leader known for his tenderness and sincerity, While American audiences may still be largely in the dark when it comes to the ins and outs of K pop and its artists our mainstream exposure fairly limited to s Gangnam Style and more recently the emergence of on the fans took to social media to share exactly what Seo meant to them, Seo Minwoo is my life mentor He gave up everything for and perfection Words are not enough to describe how great of a person he is How lovely caring and talented he is Seo Minwoo my king I love you on Twitter, Seo Minwoo gave up is acting career for Fought Top Media over and over again f ck you tm to keep together Everything he did he put his absolute everything in He openly supported LGBTQ did vlives often to talk with perfection about their concerns, Haya s current is from Dec If were a religion I d build them a church and dedicate my whole life and soul to them, While that s a lot it s indicative of the level of devotion that some K pop stars have awoken in their fans, A number of people that upcoming specific days each month on which fans post selfies with their favorite idols should be out of respect for Minwoo s fandom is, And SHINee World knows what they re going through, CHOI HYUK AFP Getty Images, On Dec SHINee singer Kim Jong hyun known as baffling fans and even fellow K pop stars who figured the year old was on top of the world, It was so shocking because we had seen him so often at events BTS told last month He was so successful, My Poet My Artist My Jonghyun I miss you In fact there are so many newly posted photos and video clips of the young man on Twitter that aside from the occasional mournful missive like this one you d be forgiven for not knowing that he s gone, Ohhhh Dear God He s so perfection, The account is also doing its part to keep his memory alive, But Jonghyun s death authorities found charred coal briquettes in a frying pan on the stove which produced carbon monoxide obviously rattled the music world at large on multiple levels In addition to the personal loss felt alike by loved ones and fans who felt they knew him mental health is not an issue that tends to get much media attention in South Korea or in Asia overall, To the South Korean government Let be the light in death that he was in life on Dec Recognize that suicide is an epidemic in South Korea and takes strides to ending the negative stigmas around mental health and to combat this issue Don t let Jonghyun be another statistic, A fan started a demanding that entertainment companies set up mental health support systems for their artists More than people have signed, Chung Sung Jun Getty Images, After some discussion his family agreed to make public the suicide note the singer and songwriter who made his solo debut in with the well received album left behind His friend and singer Jang Hee yeon known as posted it on her Instagram She said she d obtained the note two weeks before Jonghyun s death and was asked to publish it if he disappeared from the world, I m broken from the inside the note read The depression that has slowly eaten away at me has finally consumed me and I couldn t beat it, It concluded The life of fame was not for me They say it s hard to bump up against the world and become famous Why did I choose this life It s a funny thing It s a miracle that I lasted this long, What else is there to say Just tell me I did well Tell me that this is enough Tell me I worked hard Even if you can t smile please don t blame me as you send me off Well done You ve really worked hard Goodbye, Photos, In a sign that Jonghyun s death could help bring about positive change in the way mental health and depression are publicly discussed the circumstances of his death continue to be a topic of conversation one that Seo Minwoo s passing no matter what the cause only brings to mind all over again, Just Nine said on the last interview Jonghyun once told her that she brings comfort to him She noticed his condition got worse after blue night and when he gave her the letter she told his family right away tried to save him to prevent the worst from happening, everyone around him knew about his condition and tried their best to help him that s why it hurts so much that even though he got help he still wanted to leave, Read, In an last month members of BTS said that they wanted to keep the discussion about mental health going, I really want to say that everyone in the world is lonely and everyone is sad said and if we know that everyone is suffering and lonely I hope we can create an environment where we can ask for help and say things are hard when they re hard and say that we miss someone when we miss them, The Chosunilbo JNS Multi Bits via Getty Images, Bucking national mores the pressure to be upbeat or put up an artificially glossy front all the time Jonghyun who also hosted the long running music radio program had spoken out publicly about his battle with depression much like young American stars such as and have beenwidely applauded for doingthese days, His last broadcast was in March after three years behind the mic He admitted to that he didn t like traveling and considered himself a homebody and the close confines of a radio studio just him alone with some music had been a perfect fit, It may be that I came running to radio in order to escape he reflected to the magazine per an I don t really like going outside And I don t really like having to meet a lot of people I m also afraid of trying new things The radio now felt like my own personal space It had become an escape hatch for me to greet new things without feeling awkward, Jonghyun who cited personal matters as the reason he was leaving the radio show said it had become important to him to share his metaphorical scars with the world, I m fundamentally a pessimistic person he said Ever since I was little I showed a lot of depressive feelings and it s the same in the present But I don t think I can keep living my life sustaining those depressive feelings forever You might be able to go through the early to mid part of your life with that kind of melancholy But if you want to grow you can only survive if you throw those feelings away, Unless you want to get trapped within yourself and die you have to grow no matter how much it hurts but if you stop because you re afraid in the end it s inevitable that you d remain in an immature state of mind I chose the path to transform myself To reveal myself to the public To attempt to make my thoughts understood I have to make people aware that this is the kind of person I am and I can only be on the defensive if I know that they know, The translator noted that she avoided using the word depression because Jonghyun didn t use what amounted to that word specifically Even in talking about it those feelings of sadness remained a beast with no name, Photo by Chung Sung Jun Getty Images, When Jonghyun died his SHINee band mates and members of the group both groups under the S M Entertainment umbrella all clad in black carried his coffin from Asan Medical Center in Seoul to a waiting vehicle His sister headed the procession carrying a photo of her late brother, The funeral was private for friends and family only but hundreds of people lined up to see the coffin leave the hospital, A statement from S M Entertainment read in part according to The deep sorrow cannot be compared to ones of his family who had to let go of their loving son and brother but the employees and artists of SM Entertainment also in deep shock and sorrow are offering condolences Jonghyun was the best artist who loved music more than anyone and always worked hard for his performance We ask you to refrain from making rumors or assumptions based on reports in respect of his family who are in deep sorrow from the sudden news As his family wished his funeral will be carried out in the quietest manner with his family members and co workers, But Jonghyun s death was hardly the first time the punishing pace of the K pop machine had come under fire, In addition to being expected to tour and crank out albums sometimes in multiple languages SHINee had also recorded in Japanese the artists often appear on a never ending stream of competition TV series in addition to doing talk shows photo shoots and public appearances to keep the fans both sated and hungry for more, But despite the seeming glut of artists and groups to remember there are selca days truly breaking through as a star remains an elusive concept and standing out in South Korea s youth obsessed culture can feel like an insurmountable challenge, And then there s the appearance factor If a girl has a bad face and a good body the problem can be fixed with plastic surgery Kim Min seok a former trainer with YG Entertainment considered along with S M and JYP as the Big Three agencies in, Moreover the litany of groups also tend to be carefully managed meticulously packaged pop confections with a management company pulling the strings behind the scenes Those who hope to make it big are expected to dedicate their lives to that goal and that s basically what signing a contract entails, In January cited a survey of South Korean pre teens When asked about career aspirations percent said they wanted to be K pop stars, I am thinking only one thing our song keeps being played year old a member of the girl group which had an international hit at the time with their debut single Glass Bead told NBC News I hope to perform anywhere anytime even if I can t sleep or I am tired, On Feb aspiring K pop star from an apartment building with police concluding that her death was a suicide The year old had made a splash the previous year after making it to the finals of a competition show held to find girl group a new member after two girls had left, Baby Kara member Ahn So jin dead in apparent suicide She was only years old, It has to be this or nothing Sojin said on the show s premiere I can t miss this She had been a K pop trainee with Kara manager DSP Media for five years but her contract had reportedly ended the month before her death, Kara disbanded for good in January, Photos, Jang Ha Jin a year old university student who had once been a trainee with S M Entertainment after winning a talent competition in that she wasn t allowed to have a cell phone while in the program and the competition to earn a coveted slot in an actual girl group was fierce and stressful, The most difficult part in fact was when I saw myself and felt like I didn t grow up she said, The loss of individuality isn t limited to K pop either, In of Japan s a group with over rotating members who appear in different configurations at different events shaved her head and tearfully apologized in a after she spent the night with her boyfriend an apparent infraction of a no dating rule, I don t believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did but the first thing I thought was that I don t want to quit AKB Minegishi said according to the AKB s manager said Minegishi an original member of the group when it formed in had been demoted to trainee status, Her fans more appalled by the self flagellation than anything else rallied around her insisting she not be punished for just wanting to live her life, In the that members of Japanese boy band somberly dressed in black and publicly apologized on their weekly show after they attempted to leave their longtime agency Johnny Associates, The K pop scene doesn t sound quite so rigid these days with managers and producers perhaps not wanting to alienate coveted Western audiences with oppressive behavioral strictures but it still demands a level of old fashioned poise and accommodation from its artists, If you go to the agency every young trainee will give you a very polite bow and there are notices with the company rules on the wall to remind them how to behave K pop industry expert Mark Russell, In June of andof boy band to their respective fan bases for the they presumably felt when they found out that Taeyeon and Baekhyun were dating a coupling that would seemingly send their fans over the moon Jelena style, The Chosunilbo JNS Multi Bits via Getty Images, Last June of the group was after overdosing on prescription medication the incident occurring a day after he was charged with smoking marijuana a crime punishable by up to five years in prison in South Korea According to when he was caught smoking in October he issued a handwritten apology letter stating I deserve punishment for hurting the BIGBANG members agency public fans and family I ll regret this for tens of thousands of years, T O P was and received a suspended month prison sentence because the judge determined that although he had admitted his guilt and disappointed his family and fans he seemed sufficiently remorseful, I m truly sorry that I disappointed my fans and the public the year old whose real name is Choi Seung Hyun after his sentencing last summer I will do my best to make a fresh start and not to make such a mistake again with what I ve learned from this lesson, In August management company that of was taking a break from the group while she sought treatment for anorexia stating We will wholeheartedly support JinE while she rests and receives treatment We apologize once more for bringing this sudden news to fans and ask that you continue to show Oh My Girl unchanging love and interest JinE s from the group was announced in October, It s impossible not to note a hint of concern over past K pop tragedy and the pitfalls of fame in this otherwise cheerful birthday greeting sent today already March in South Korea to Cha Eunwoo or of the six member boy band, Mr Cha Eunwoo Happy birthday to our sweet and sparkling fluff AROHA are so lucky to have you who changed her handle to happychaeunwooday for the occasion Stay happy and healthy,

information services, Follow The Sun, The Sun, News Corp, Services, Theresa May accused of letting down Leave voters by sacrificing immigration controls for the next three years, Migration Watch slammed the Prime Minister for compromising on the Brexit transition deal, THERESA MAY was today accused of betraying millions of Leave voters by surrendering any attempt to tackle EU immigration in talks with Brussels, In an unprecedented attack Migration Watch slammed the PM for a cop out on border controls and warned it would come back to haunt her, It said that if ministers fail to restrict EU migration in the the electorate will not readily forgive them, Alp Mehmet the think tank s vice chair said the PM s transition deal with Brussels meant Britain had signed up to almost three more years of unlimited EU immigration, He accused the Government of caving into business chiefs who profit handsomely favour from free movement and forgetting the views of ordinary voters on the doorsteps, Writing for The Sun he stormed Immigration was not just an important reason for the Brexit vote it was according to the polls THE single most important issue of voter concern on the eve of referendum day in June, While the voice of voters may have been heard in the referendum result it is also all too clear that it has since been largely ignored, Migration Watch has been hugely supportive of Theresa May But its attack reflects growing fears among Brexit supporters that the Government has gone soft on its promise to respond to the nation s alarm about unrestricted EU immigration, It came just hours after Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees Mogg said Britain will suffer its biggest national humiliation since Suez unless it delivers a clean Brexit, The senior backbencher said that if the country were not to leave it would cause the most almighty smash to the national psyche that could be imagined, The transition deal signed last week will allow unlimited EU immigration until the end of, Ministers caved in to the EU s demands and said any will be allowed full residency rights A separate agreement on the same day lifted restrictions on Croatian nationals meaning they too will be able to do likewise, Official figures in February revealed a net EU citizens came to Britain last year the first time in years the number has fallen below, But the total number of EU migrants living in the UK has more than doubled to million since border controls were relaxed for a string of Eastern European nations by Tony Blair in, The Sun urged ex PM David Cameron to draw a red line on immigration in warning there was every chance the country will vote to get out in a EU Referendum, Theresa May s official spokesman last July vowed that free movement would end in March, It came after Home Secretary Amber Rudd a fierce Remain campaigner hinted at a relatively liberal post Brexit migration scheme, Earlier this month Ms Rudd claimed that recent falls in EU migration had taken away the urgency to bring forward new proposals for post Brexit immigration rules, MOST READ IN POLITICS, DELETE AND DISOWN, ROAD RAGE, ANTIQUE IVORY BANNED, I WAS JEZ WRONG, WAGE WAR, An Immigration Bill originally expected earlier this year may not be published after until Brexit in one year s time, Former Cabinet Minister Priti Patel has demanded the Home Secretary level with the nation and set out what the post Brexit border plan will be, She told The Sun earlier this month It s in the public interest to have all everything in place so we know what immigration policy is going to look like on March and that means bringing legislation forward to have a very clear idea, Control of our borders More of a complete cop out says Migration Watch, ALP MEHMET vice chair of Migration Watch says Theresa May has let down voters with her Brexit transition deal, The transition agreement with the EU formally approved on Friday is useless for controlling immigration, Free movement for citizens of the EU is to continue for nearly three years from now Worse all those who arrive in that period will acquire the right to permanent residence, Over the last ten years or so on average about half a million EU citizens every year have applied for a National Insurance number at one of our job centres From June Croatians will also be able to do the same and stay indefinitely if they so choose, Nobody knows how many of those coming to work will be tempted to stay many to be joined by family members when they know that the gates are about to close, Those who voted to leave the EU because they felt strongly about our loss of control of EU migration rightly believed their voice had finally been heard The Government thus far have let them down badly they are right to feel aggrieved, Immigration was not just an important reason for the Brexit vote it was according to the polls the single most important issue of voter concern on the eve of referendum day in June, While the voice of voters may have been heard in the referendum result it is also all too clear that it has since been largely ignored The Government might have been influenced by more recent opinion polls which show that immigration has fallen slightly down the public s list of concerns, If that is true it is because they expect Brexit to deliver on their expectations It is looking increasingly likely that they will be sorely disappointed, Last Tuesday s agreement on the transition arrangements are a complete cop out on immigration, Ultimately employers who are either not themselves affected by mass immigration or who profit handsomely from it want as little change as possible to current arrangements They have been supported by those who have always favoured loose immigration controls and they have won hands down, The Government it seems were ready to sacrifice immigration control to achieve an interim agreement, If this should be the eventual result the electorate will not readily forgive them, Comments, Most Popular, RAPE MOB, Mob parade men naked through town after they were accused of raping teenager, FINAL JOURNEY, Redmayne pays tribute at Stephen Hawking s funeral as

It will probably be less than you think as most of us are so scared of running out of data that we over estimate the our needs and end up paying far too much, Haggle your way to a cheaper mobile deal, The average Brit leaves GB of their data allowance unused every month according to research by the comparison site uSwitch, Once you ve got your data and call requirements figured out head to a comparison website like Moneysupermarket com uSwitch com or Broadbandchoices co uk and tap in your details, Pick out the best deals from rival providers that match the combination of minutes and data you are looking for and also check whether your current provider is offering a much better package for new customers, In your case I found that Three was offering the same bundle you are currently on with GB of data minutes and unlimited texts for just a month if you re a new customer which must be pretty galling when you re paying, As with most types of financial contract loyalty seldom pays with phone companies devoting all their efforts into attracting new customers rather than keeping their existing ones happy, I also found a deal from Virgin Mobile for the same price with more data and minutes which really boosts your negotiating power because you can make a credible threat to leave, MOST READ IN MONEY, SHOP SMART, SUPERMARKET SAVVY, EASTER FEASTER, SUPERMARKET SWEEP, EASTER UPDATES, NOT JUST ANY EASTER, Now that you know exactly what else is out there you can call your mobile company and ask to be put through to the disconnection department, You reported back to me that by saying you were going to move your contract to Virgin and by pointing out that Three was offering a much better package to its new customers you were able to bring your bill down to a month, And better still your fianc e Ruth used the same tactics to bring her bill down from to just a month all without either of you having to switch provider, So your respective bargaining skills have saved you a total of a year which is no doubt a welcome boost to your wedding fund, Well done for to you both for holding your nerve and saving yourselves so much money, Comments, Most Popular, SHOP SMART,

education and information services, Follow The Sun, Your Sun, Editions, The Sun, News Corp, Services, Fantasy football The best and worst player price changes on Dream Team this season, We can all understand the satisfaction of taking a punt on a bargain player in pre season and watch as his valuation soars following a string of fine performances, And we ve also watched in horror as a seemingly nailed on points scorer gradually drops in price as he struggles to even make the bench, Have you signed up to play Dream Team Weekender, Winners, When Liverpool snapped up Salah from Roma over the summer we all knew about his history, Once upon a time he was a promising but fairly unknown winger who was signed by Chelsea but spent long periods of his time at Stamford Bridge on the bench, From there he moved to Serie A where a brief spell with Fiorentina followed a decent run out in Rome before the Reds paid a pretty penny for him back in June, Mohamed Salah has been directly involved in goals in the this season goals assist, UEFA Champions League ChampionsLeague, None of us really knew how well he d do at Anfield but goals later in all competitions including in the Premier League and a massive haul of points on Dream Team tells you all you need to know, At the start of the year he was priced at just m but has since risen to a staggering m and it s still rising By far the best fantasy football signing you could make this season, We ve always known this guy was pretty good, But this season under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola Sterling has been one of Man City s key figures as they storm towards the Premier League title, , Raheem Sterling sterling, Alongside the likes of Sergio Aguero Gabriel Jesus and Leroy Sane as well as enjoying the service of Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva behind him Sterling has netted times in the league this season, That s more than his previous two campaigns combined while his rating is through the roof right now, He s still not a resounding Dream Team favourite with only of you lot picking him at the moment but he s shot up in value from m at the start of the season to m, Kane was already the most expensive player on Dream Team when we first unveiled our player prices at the start of the season, The Spurs striker going into the new season with two consecutive Premier League Golden Boot awards was the priced at m but that s risen to an eye watering m since, I guess that s what happens when you score goals in all competitions and bring home Dream Team points, It s been another incredible season for Sergio Aguero who s been the jewel in the crown of Man City s charge towards the title, goals in the league and four in the Champions League helped him become City s all time leading scorer back in November, And he s been well worth a place in your Dream Team too despite rumours at the start of the season that he d struggle to break into the starting XI with the emergence of Gabriel Jesus, The City theme is strong here isn t it, KDB will probably win the Player of the Year award this season and rightly so, He s been the engine behind City s table topping success and is a regular Dream Team points scorer Even with his price rise he s well worth the m we re forcing you to fork out for him, Losers, We couldn t find anyone with a worse drop in price than this guy which initially surprised us, Until we realised we haven t heard much from him since early last year apart from that equalising goal against Burnley last month, Pellegrino errors so far this season Persisting with F Forster in goal Continuing to play up front Dropping JWP Dropping PEH Leaving Gabbiadini on the bench all season Dropping players in form Keeping faith with Tadic Not understanding the fans, JPS sorrell john, In fact that was his first strike since mid October in an awful campaign that s seen him in and out of Southampton s starting line up and a big part of their slump under Mauricio Pellegrino, Considering he was quite the revelation last season he seemed like a bargain at m back in the summer but now he s just small change at m, Sigh it seems year after year we long to see this guy come good again, However it s been another season where we ve simply glimpsed the underlying talent that Carroll posses, Two goals against West Brom back in January but a long injury lay off since has pretty much summed up the big man s career, Once he s back if he s back this season you can pick him up for a bargain m which is a long way off his start of the season value, Keano s big money move to Everton from Burnley in the summer was meant to be the centre back s big break, But instead, I might just be making excuses for him but I think Michael Keane can still go on to be a great centre back for us First few games of the season when he was playing with confidence he was quality Would be hard for even Maldini playing inbetween Martina and Williams, Andy Castell AJ, Just points on the game so far and a woeful campaign in Blue Keane will be lucky if he s kept on at Goodison Park next season, We take it he s no longer in your Dream Team right, Perhaps another surprise until you look back at the stats, As an attacking midfielder who supposedly likes to dash forward Wijnaldum only has one goal to his name this season in a win over Huddersfield back in October despite regularly featuring in Jurgen Klopp s high flying side, We re sure he s doing alright in other areas but he s certainly not a fantasy football darling, There s a host of players who ve dropped in price by m but Pickford at the start of the season at least was by far one of the most popular, An excellent campaign for Sunderland despite the relegation and a big money move to Everton in the summer was supposed to be the start of something big but his price has fallen dramatically since, WHAT A SAVE Jordan Pickford denies Burnley an equalizer, NBC Sports Soccer NBCSportsSoccer, Not that his stock in any lower as he s still considered the favourite for England s No spot at the World Cup this summer while he s hardly at fault for the Toffees woeful campaign, , , Comments, Most Popular, RAPE MOB, Mob parade men naked

of my life, STEVE Jobs is widely regarded as a visionary responsible for changing the world by leading Apple s creation of the iPhone, But a new book by author Brian Merchant claims the high pressure fear driven environment that Jobs created cost people their marriages and their sanity, In a tell all book called Merchant portrays Jobs as a taskmaster pitting members of his company against each other in intense conditions resulting in disastrous personal outcomes, Employees of the iPhone project were told you re going to have to give up nights and weekends probably for a couple years as we make this product according to the book, The work lived up to that prophecy, Senior iPhone engineer Andy Grignon called the work professionally one of the worst times of my life and claimed the iPhone is the reason I m divorced, The sentiment was echoed by multiple Apple employees, Jobs split the iPhone team into two task groups referred to as P and P pitting them against each other, P was tasked with adding phone functionality to the existing iPod, They eventually produced a phone that used the click wheel to scroll through a virtual rotary dial, P the winning team was tasked with designing a phone using the now ubiquitous touch interface, As Merchant tells it tensions were so high that executives from the two teams would barely be able to tolerate sitting in the same room together, Grignon described the soup of misery as a pressure cooker of a bunch of really smart people with an impossible deadline an impossible mission, Jobs also insisted on an intense level of secrecy for the project partly because as one employee described he was just naturally paranoid, MOST READ IN TECH AND SCIENCE, CRACKING UP, TIN HATS AT THE READY, WATCH OUT, CYBER SAFE, KIDS NEW OBSESSION, He chose the office for the project that became known by its codename Purple because it was windowless, Cleaning crews weren t allowed in because Jobs didn t want them to see what was written on the whiteboards, According to iPhone software lead developer Scott Forstall Apple locked the entire floor down, He said We put doors with badge readers there were cameras I think to get to some of our labs you had to badge in four times to get there, Forestall told Merchant that there were even posters reminding employees to keep the project secret Jobs put up a sign that said Fight Club because the first rule of Fight Club in the movie is that you don t talk about Fight Club, Jobs was notorious for his hot temper and unconventional business tactics He has famously fired employees in public and without notice, The book also reveals that Jobs was one of the biggest roadblocks to the success of the iPod and creation of the iPhone despite their prominent roles in cementing Jobs legacy, ,

opportunities are posted on our, Program Structure, How is this Nanodegree program structured, The program is comprised of terms months each with fixed start and end dates Students must successfully complete all assigned projects by the end date for each term to graduate There are projects per term which give you an opportunity to apply the skills you ve learned in the lessons Each project must be submitted for review by one of the expert project reviewers in the Udacity Robotics network Your reviewer will give you detailed feedback on your work and let you know where your project needs improvement if necessary You may submit each project as many times as you like, Are there Udacity Connect sessions held for this program, No not currently Students of this program are welcome to attend Connect sessions but we will not provide curriculum support at the sessions nor will there be session leads onsite who are equipped to provide specific program guidance and input, Do you offer the opportunity for students to pause their studies for this program, No this is not an option The fixed term nature of the program and the need for maintaining a consistent and stable student body throughout doesn t allow for offering the option to pause your studies, Is this program self paced, The start and end dates of each term are fixed and you must complete all assigned projects by the end dates so to that extent the answer is no it is not self paced You must complete the program within a fixed time period However projects may be submitted at any time during the term and individual project deadlines are recommendations not requirements So within the boundaries of a given term there is some opportunity to work at your own pace But you should plan to follow our recommended timeline as this will best enable you to keep pace with your peers and complete the program on time, Deadline Policy, When we use the term deadline with regards to Nanodegree Program projects we use it in one of two ways, It is very important to understand the distinctions between the two as your progress in the program is measured against the deadlines we ve established Please see below for an explanation of what each usage means, A final deadline for submitting all projects, In order to graduate a term you must submit all projects by the last day of the term and pass all projects once they are reviewed by a Udacity Reviewer the review may take place after the last day of the term Passing a project means a Udacity Reviewer has marked a project as Meets Specifications, If you do not submit all projects by the end of the term and also pass all projects once they are reviewed you will receive a week extension to complete any outstanding projects You will only receive this extension a maximum of once Once you submit and pass all projects you can enroll in the next term which will potentially be with a later class If you do not submit and pass all projects within the week extension you will be removed from the program, Ongoing suggested deadlines for individual projects, The deadlines you see in your classroom are suggestions for when you should ideally pass each project They are meant to help keep you on track so that you maintain an appropriate pace throughout the program one that will see you graduate on time, Please note that you can submit your project as many times as you need to There are no penalties if you miss these deadlines However you will be at risk of not passing all projects on time if you miss these deadlines and fall behind so it is a recommended best practice to try and meet each suggested deadline, Featured Programs, Only At Udacity, Resources, Programs, Company, Business, Support, Udacity Inc, Nanodegree is a registered

list Especially when the goal is most likely to get some R R, But leave it to celebs to make it all look so easy, This summer we followed in awe as and vacationed with in Italy And then we got all giddy over s mid flight and having a blast, Stars don t just make traveling with kids look easy they make it look glamorous So we asked parenting coach LCSW and author of the best selling book about how they do it, Not only did we get our answers but she also shared some valuable insight into improving travel experiences when you ve got a baby on board, Photos, Celebrities have assistants and teams managing their daily lives which does make vacations much easier While schedules and itineraries are being handled a star can focus on getting their child ready to go out the door Nannies also help with allowing parents to find some personal time to recharge or enjoy a few activities away from their kids But according to Mercedes the key here isn t the extra help it s knowing it s there if they need it, Even if a celeb forgoes all that they still have a leg up because they have access to it which gives a celeb parent piece of mind when they start to feel overwhelmed she explained It s the knowing that I have someone I can trust to help when it gets to be too much that I believe can truly make or break a parent s resolve and sanity, Photos, A post shared by Reese Witherspoon reesewitherspoon on, When having extra help isn t an option staying organized is essential no matter how long you plan to be away Try to plan your itinerary as early in advance as you can Mercedes said Not only is it more cost effective but it gives you a chance to talk to your children about where you are going and what they can expect as far as travelling, While packing include the items that make your kids feel most comfortable like blankies and special videos This also means letting them eat their favorite snacks more than normal like This might seem contrary but Mercedes explained travel is not the time to keep strict boundaries around screen time or food habits Children do well with familiarity and traveling is the very opposite of what is familiar, For a smoother trip bring items that make life easier and at the same time won t cause issues at customs Mercedes suggests mobile devices for entertainment and self soothing Diaper bags can double as purses and toddlers can pick out their own backpacks to get excited about the journey before you even take off, Look into shipping some of your items to your destination beforehand to bypass baggage claim, Photos, A post shared by chrissy teigen chrissyteigen on, According to Mercedes the two most common mistakes parents make when traveling are not preparing and having unrealistic expectations In reality no matter how much you plan traveling is unpredictable Staying organized gives your child a solid foundation from the beginning whether or not the plane is delayed and it s pouring on your beach holiday Don t get mad at yourself over mishaps that are out of your control Instead find a solution, Even when you ve got celebrity status each trip is also a good learning experience think about what went well and what could have gone better How could you have prepared more effectively Use this information for a more successful family vacation next time around As for unrealistic expectations choose destinations and trips that are age appropriate to help build up your kid s resiliency Want to go on a Maybe not if you ve still got toddlers, The idea is not to do less to accommodate your child but to be mindful of how you can help you and your child learn more about each other s travel behaviors and tweak accordingly, Photos, Family travel can certainly be a hassle but there are so many benefits to having that adventure together You re exposing your children to new places and cultures that can help them develop a greater understanding of the world at a young age It s also an important break from day to day work parenting and life in general For stars travel is an escape from the spotlight with the people they cherish the most, While I won t be na ve in saying that the benefits outweigh the cons of

running MTV series gathered at San Diego Comic Con one last time this weekend and sat down with E News to talk about saying goodbye Star even busted out a new word just for us, It s definitely a little melancholy That s the right word for it right he said turning to fellow cast members and I ve never used that word, And you used it at Comic Con Hennig added It s weird because I don t think anybody else is having the same experience as us, Photos, MTV, Posey described a dinner during last year s Comic Con just after it was announced that was ending where he watched a montage of all the different promos put together for each season, I had been to every single one of these promos I was there for them all and it really hit me hard he told us Like I started shaking and like holy s t this is real and really happening It was the first time I ever really felt that when it comes to, While Christian told us that his final scene was bloody Hennig s was not, My exit was naked she revealed Came in naked left naked cried on a pillow wasn t supposed to, I was there for both those times too Posey exclaimed, While he wouldn t say if the ending Posey envisioned involved Hennig naked the star did say he had an end in mind, I kinda just saw the ending I had an ideal scene ending he told us It didn t happen that way because the writers aren t in my head but I m still really happy with how it ended I just had a different idea for it, The last shot of the show is really beautiful Hennig added, Read, Melissa Ponzio who has played Scott McCall s badass mom since the very beginning of the show told us she was feeling all of the emotions as the show ended, Happiness and sadness and, Celebration added, I mean it s hard said It s never easy to say see ya goodbye And it s been a huge part of our lives and it s hard It s hard to let it go, For me it definitely hit after there was no work Khylin Rhambo told us The week after once I realized oh man there s no call times You get into a rhythm of filming and once it s over that s when it really hit me But the last day was moreso like a beautiful experience I just got to watch everyone have a special moment together It was just like a love bond between everyone, I think too when the fans found out it was the last season watching that hit was really hard Carver told us But I think that they re going to be very excited to see how everything sort of gets wrapped up in this next season, Speaking of the fans Hennig observed that this year s panel was a little bit different from panels in the past when the show wasn t about to end First of all it was moderated by Ponzio Ashby and creator making it more of a conversation between cast members than a typical panel, This one was a little melancholy a little solemn she told us I think they wanted to make sure they didn t miss out on anything we said Normally they re like screaming yelling and I think they were really listening to make sure they got the last of it and I think we were doing the same A couple of us were actually nervous for the first time It was an interesting vibe, She described the end of the show like the end of high school and the rest of the cast agreed, You re excited for what s next and you re also scared to say goodbye Christian added That s what it feels like, , returns Sunday at p m on MTV, FOMO no More, sign up now, success, Thank you

t have as much success as me so I think it gets them riled up because they re not selling as much as I am I honestly think that s what it boils down to I don t want to say it s just people being

inspired us to try and figure that out, Most Popular, We can all agree that Millennials are the worst But what a Millennial A fight between and inspired us to try and figure that out, After the ran giving employers tips on how to deal with Millennials for example they need regular naps I didn t read the article that s from my experience s Amanda Hess that the examples the used to demonstrate their points weren t actually Millennials Some of the people quoted in the article were as old as which was considered elderly only short years ago, The age of employees of the humble website you are currently reading varies widely meaning that we too have in the past wondered where the boundaries for the various generations were drawn Is a year old who gets text message condolences from her friends a Millennial by virtue of her behavior Or is she some other generation because she was born super long ago Sorry year old Rebecca Soffer who is a friend of a friend of mine and who I met once You re not actually that old Since is committed to Broadening Human Understanding I decided to find out where generational boundaries are drawn, I started by calling the Census Bureau A representative called me back without much information We do not define the different generations she told me The only generation we do define is Baby Boomers and that year bracket is from to, Next I spoke with Tom DiPrete a sociology professor at Columbia University And he agreed with the Census Bureau I think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media DiPrete said and the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation It had specific characteristics and occurred within an observable timeframe World War II ended You had the post war rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family Then societal changes disrupted those patterns and the generation for academic purposes was over His main point History isn t always so punctuated, I understood why Generation X a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty would be poorly defined But what about Millennials Doesn t their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers I actually haven t seen efforts to document generations rigorously and I would be somewhat skeptical that they be documented rigorously DiPrete said The things that have shaped Millennials the rise of technology and social networks for example affect people s lives differently, The media in particular wants definitions identities DiPrete said I don t know that the definitions are as strong or as widely shared across all the boundaries At the end I think it gets fuzzy, Well yeah We want definitions And if it s the media that draws the boundaries then allow us to do so definitively, Your official demarcation of generational boundaries, We identified six different generations and labeled their eras, These are the people that fought and died in World War II for our freedom which we appreciate But it s a little over the top as far as names go isn t it Tom Brokaw made the name up and everyone loved it What you re going to argue with your grandfather that he in the greatest generation The generation ended when the war ended, This is the agreed upon generation that falls within DiPrete s punctuated timeframe It began when the Greatest Generation got home and started having sex with everyone it ended when having sex with everyone was made easier with The Pill, George Masnick of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies this generation in the timeframe of to in part because it s a neat year period He also calls it the baby bust mocking p undits on Madison Avenue and in the media that call it Generation X Ha ha tough luck, Masnick addresses this group too putting it anywhere from the mid s when the oldest were born to the mid s when the youngest were But mostly Generation Y is a made up generation when it became obvious that young kids didn t really fit with the cool Generation X aesthetic but not enough of them had been born to make a new generation designation Generation Y is a fake made up thing Do not worry about it, In October researchers Neil Howe and William Strauss Millennials the next great generation which is funny They define the group as as those born in and approximately the years thereafter In they affixed the end point, But that means that kids born in the last years lack a designation They Millennials Earlier this month Pew Research what the group should be called and offered some terrible ideas In other words this is the new Generation Y We ll figure out what they re called in the future, Here we made a helpful chart, There you have it The experts say the media get to determine when generations happen and we re the media We also get to say which generations are the worst and the Millennials are the worst But you already knew that, Couples Speak Honestly About Open Relationships, Non monogamous couples speak candidly about the challenges and rewards of their unconventional lifestyle, About the Author, Most Popular, Donald Trump Doesn t Understand Community Colleges, In a speech on Thursday he revealed he doesn t appreciate the vital role they play in the country s education system and economy, During a speech on Thursday President Trump revealed a striking ignorance of one of the pillars of his country s educational system In the course of promoting his infrastructure plan he a bit perplexingly dismissed the country s community colleges suggesting he doesn t know what purpose they serve We do not know what a community college means he told the crowd in an Ohio training facility for construction apprentices moments after expressing nostalgia for the vocational schools that flourished when he was growing up schools that offered hands on training in fields such as welding and cosmetology, He seemed to have a better grasp on these latter schools analogizing them to the apprenticeship programs he was promoting in his effort to create high paying infrastructure jobs The implication as he brushed aside one form of higher education and lauded another was that he d like to resuscitate short term training opportunities and phase out community colleges in the name of workforce development, The Americanization of an Ancient Faith, The year old Coptic Church is trying something new spreading its message across the United States and the rest of the world, One day in the fall of Father Anthony Messeh then a priest at the St Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in Fairfax Virginia sat down with a list of names There were individuals all American converts with no Egyptian heritage who had been baptized at the church since his arrival in Of the group only eight were still active members, That just broke my heart Messeh told me one afternoon last summer If one or two people had left then maybe I could say it was something wrong with them But if out of had left that meant it s something wrong with me, One American couple who d left the congregation told him that while the church felt like a family it didn t feel like family St Mark s like many of the over Coptic churches in the United States is overwhelmingly comprised of Copts raised in Egypt or born to Egyptian parents Of the nearly members of the church most still converse comfortably in Arabic and the services retain Egyptian cultural norms Men and women tend to sit separately people move around freely during prayers and Egyptian food is often served, The Case Against High School Sports, The United States routinely spends more tax dollars per high school athlete than per high school math student unlike most countries worldwide And we wonder why we lag in international education rankings, thousands of teenagersmove to the United States from all over the world for all kinds of reasons They observe everything in their new country with fresh eyes including basic features of American life that most of us never stop to consider, One element of our education system consistently surprises them Sports are a big deal here says Jenny who moved to America from South Korea with her family in Shawnee High her public school in southern New Jersey fields teams in sports over the course of the school year including golf and bowling Its campus has lush grass fields six tennis courts and an athletic Hall of Fame They have days when teams dress up in Hawaiian clothes or pajamas just because We re the soccer team Jenny says To protect the privacy of Jenny and other students in this story only their first names are used, Chicago s Awful Divide, Americans are flocking to big cities to find good jobs opportunities that remain disproportionately out of reach for the poorest residents already living there, CHICAGO Americans hear a lot these days about the country s urban rural divide Rural counties are poorer urban ones richer Rural areas are losing jobs urban ones are gaining them People with a college education are leaving rural areas They re moving to urban places, Behind this divergence lies a straightforward story The twin forces of globalization and technological change are a handful of big urban areas while resources are drained from the heartland leaving it often devoid of opportunity and prosperity But this neat division rural versus urban erases another part of the story of America s changing economy the pressure that those twin forces are exerting within cities pulling some people up to the very top while pushing others to an unforgiving bottom In some prosperous cities such as Chicago where the number of has grown fourfold since people at the bottom are struggling as much as they always have if not more illustrating that it s not just the white rural poor who are being left behind in today s economy The disconnect is why Andrew Diamond the author of has called Chicago a combination of Manhattan smashed against Detroit, The Diet That Might Cure Depression, Several studies show that healthy eating is connected with better mood, At the turn of the th century prominent physicians who were trying to understand where mental illness comes from seized on a new theory autointoxication Intestinal microbes these doctors suggested are actually dangerous to their human hosts They fatigue melancholia and the neuroses as a historical article in the journal recounts, The control of man s diet is readily accomplished but mastery over his intestinal bacterial flora is not a doctor named Bond Stow in the in The innumerable examples of autointoxication that one sees in his daily walks in life is proof thereof malaise total lack of ambition so that every effort in life is a burden mental depression often bordering upon melancholia, The Ball Is Very Much in the Russian Court, Avoiding another Cold War may require Moscow to change course, On Thursday it was Americans who learned they were being kicked out of Russia On Friday it was Europeans Russia s Foreign Ministry of several European nations and ordered the expulsion of their diplomats their number precisely mirrored the number of Russian diplomats expelled by Western nations on Monday In all nations expelled Russians over the past week in response to Moscow s alleged role in the by nerve agent of Sergei Skripal a former Russian spy and his daughter Yulia in the U K The U S expelled by far the highest number of Russians and Moscow responded in kind The U K expelled and faced similar retaliation, The Last Temptation, How evangelicals once culturally confident became an anxious minority seeking political protection from the least traditionally religious president in living memory, about our current politics really one of the most extraordinary developments of recent political history is the loyal adherence of religious conservatives to Donald Trump The president won of white evangelical Christians This was a higher level of support than either Ronald Reagan or George W Bush an outspoken evangelical himself ever received, Trump s background and beliefs could hardly be more incompatible with traditional Christian models of life and leadership Trump s past political stances he once supported the right to partial birth abortion his character he has bragged about sexually assaulting women and even his language he introduced the words and into presidential discourse would more naturally lead religious conservatives toward exorcism than alliance This is a man who has cruelly publicized his infidelities made disturbing sexual comments about his elder daughter and boasted about the size of his penis on the debate stage His lawyer reportedly arranged a payment to a porn star to dissuade her from disclosing an alleged affair Yet religious conservatives who once blanched at PG public standards now yawn at such NC maneuvers We are a long way from, Immigrants Give America a Foreign Policy Advantage, History proves they can help the U S keep other countries in check, It has often been thought that the composition of the American public consisting as it does of immigrants from so many lands is a vulnerability in foreign policy that for example German immigrants would harbor affinities for their land of origin and become disloyal during the world wars The argument was taken to a shameful extreme with the internment of Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor What has received less attention is the extent to which America s immigrant fabric can be a foreign policy advantage even a threat to other countries That is what British Prime Minister Palmerston feared and what President Lincoln stoked to forestall British recognition of the Confederacy during the Civil War The result was an important inhibition on Great Britain then the most powerful state of the international order, Unpacking the Fictional Japan of, Wes Anderson s film uses elements of the country s language and culture to create a fraught sense of unfamiliarity, One of the best sequences in Wes Anderson s new stop motion film is of a sushi chef preparing a boxed lunch In a bird s eye shot we see the chef s hands pin a still living fish chop off its head and tail set it to the side in a shallow bowl and fillet the carcass A wriggling octopus leg is held deftly cut into neat rectangles and pressed onto handfuls of vinegar rice The chef dots vivid green wasabi on each slice of octopus arranging the sushi carefully in a lacquered bento box This beautifully executed sequence is identical to the process so many sushi undertake as they stand behind counters performing for hungry audiences It is also the only scene in that needs to be set in Japan, Couples Speak Honestly About Open Relationships, Non monogamous couples speak candidly about the challenges and rewards of their unconventional lifestyle, The President Sang Amazing Grace,

work out cheaper for those who do, The best way to find a new deal is by checking comparison websites such as MoneySupermarket and uSwitch com which compare tariffs and handset prices, It s also worth trying Billmonitor it matches buyers to the best pay monthly deal based on their previous three months of bills, It only works if you re a customer of EE O Three Vodafone or Tesco Mobile and you ll

explores why relationship break ups soar after the blubber is shed, HOT on the heels of celebs being lambasted for their unrealistic and unsustainable fitness DVDs weight loss is once again in the news, This time it s all about and how although the end result can be dramatic it s not just the unwanted fat that melts away, Relationships also disappear with, There are a number of reasons being put forward by Swedish scientists from the University of the Bleeding Obvious who conducted the research, People who lose a hell of lot of weight after an operation find they have a new zest for life and increased confidence, All of a sudden they are more energetic they can wear flattering clothes instead of tent like kaftans and the whole world appears in colour rather than black and white, Dismayed husbands see their unhappy unhealthy wives emerge from surgery like beautiful butterflies and they suddenly feel insecure and unsure, Or women see their fat husbands lose their beer bellies and start receiving admiring glances, Many don t appreciate the transformation from dowdy to downright desirable, Having a gastric band fitted is not a straightforward procedure, You have to and need to and take care of yourself, People who once looked for comfort in over eating junk food have to change their way of life completely To fill the void some join gyms or exercise classes sign up for swimming lessons or simply get up and go for a hike or a walk in the country crisps and chocolate are no longer viable when you need to be careful about every teaspoonful of grub that passes your lips, Their partners simply don t recognise this brand new person and feel at sea, Sex lives that were moribund become far more active and although most men would claim that they want to be at it like rabbits in reality a partner with an increased libido can be intimidating, The balance of power can change with the in the relationship having to realise that three pizzas and a whole chicken for dinner is not an option for their partner any more, Their lifestyle also has to alter and if there were cracks in the marriage before the surgery afterwards these can widen to Grand Canyon proportions, Sometimes the gastric band operation can give the person who has lost shedloads of weight the boost needed to leave an unhealthy relationship, They could have long been and subjugated and even derided for being fat, Partners can also feel jealous of their post surgery enhanced new look other half, If it s a toxic partnership then it s actually for the best that the two of them decide to go their separate ways, But even if it s a strong and loving relationship there will be bumps along the road, And if someone is miserable and unhappy simply having a procedure that means they take up less space in the world won t automatically turn them into the life and soul of the party, Strip of a lifetime, HUGE congratulations to all of the, They all had their own reasons for taking part in a specially televised programme over two nights, The Real Full Monty was a warm hearted and funny way to get the message across about men checking their tackle and women being aware of any changes in

might of the law and demanded vile should remain behind bars, But how many other while remaining a danger to society, , I m surely not the only one concerned that not only do rapists such as Worboys receive insultingly short sentences to begin with he was jailed for a minimum of just eight years but are then back on the streets far too soon and highly likely to, There s been lots of hand wringing and promises of change but it s going to take a long time before the Parole Board regains our trust if it ever does, Labour need Ed teacher, EDDIE Marsan is one of our greatest actors, He s a total chameleon and manages to get under the skin of every single character he plays, You will have most recently seen him on TV as a washed up ex boxer suffering from Parkinson s disease in Ray Donovan And he s up next in the highly anticipated with Ryan Reynolds, Bizarrely this top bloke has been getting grief on social media because he quite rightly spoke out about the appalling within the Labour Party, A half witted Corbynista basically accused him of being a hypocrite because he once played Heinrich Himmler in a film and wore an SS uniform complete with swastika, We really shouldn t have to point out that Eddie is an actor and that was simply a role he was playing not a political statement, He s also not a police inspector or a driving instructor Happy Go Lucky or an angry violent alcoholic Tyrannosaur, If it wasn t so utterly dumb it would be funny, And how insultingly stupid that some ill educated people think it s OK to berate an actor for doing a damned fine job, Classy Lesley is mum in million, ONCE in a while a TV show comes along grabs hold of your heart and doesn t let go, You care so deeply about the characters that it keeps you awake at night counting down the hours until the next episode, So it has been with the divine Mum on BBC a pitch perfect bittersweet comedy that had me blubbing like a baby during the last episode of the series this week, Every aspiring actor should study the performances of as Cathy the newly widowed mum of the title and as Michael the man who has loved her for almost all of his life, They both give a masterclass in understated authentic emotion conveying everything with just a tilt of their head or a simple look, We desperately want them to get together and it s been agonising seeing them unable to express their feelings thanks to acute shyness and almost constant interruptions, The supporting cast of Cathy s grumpy in laws her thick as a plank selfish son and his bubble headed girlfriend a needy brother and his gargoyle of a partner could easily have been sitcom cliches, Instead they are fully rounded flawed irritating but ultimately sympathetic characters thanks to a combination of cracking writing and top acting, We know people like this and there s not been a single bum note in the whole of the two series, A gentle comedy about love and loss where nothing much happens and people chunter on about crisps and garden centres really shouldn t be this good, It s one of my proudest moments to have been given a name check on this exceptional show when Cathy s father in law reckoned I was so cheery it was his dearest wish to walk around Debenhams with me, I would be honoured, A sweetie way to earn a bit of pocket money, ONE of the joys of my childhood was collecting empty ginger lemonade and cola bottles and trading them in for cold hard cash that we spent on the penny tray in the corner shop, It was an easy way to get free sweeties and kept the streets free from litter and broken glass So I m really interested to see this scheme being reintroduced but this time mainly focusing on plastic bottles and cans which are choking up our countryside rivers seas and oceans, MOST READ IN OPINION,

Surrogate to Carry Baby No, , Let the name game begin, Multiple sources tell E News that has decided to have another baby with husband The E reality star and the Grammy winning musician are already parents to daughter and son months Because Kim has placenta accreta making a third pregnancy potentially life threatening they used an agency to hire a surrogate, The question of whether to have another child is one Kim has been public about in the past, In the Nov episode of Kim who celebrated her third wedding anniversary May said she would love to maybe have another baby So she talked to OB GYN to weigh her options given her complicated pregnancies and deliveries Because she suffered from toxemia and a retained placenta which was traumatic on her body the odds of her having another difficult pregnancy are higher Dr Crane explained, Watch, Bryan Bedder Getty Images, We re always worried about the next serious complication You re always taking a little bit of a chance There are situations where retained placenta could be life and death Dr Crane told Kim At her big sister s recommendation Kim met with fertility specialist to get a second opinion He too said she d likely experience a high risk pregnancy, Kim has spoken often about her fertility issues In fact as she admitted to in Every medical issue that you could probably have I feel like I get and I worry so much about it And though she didn t think it was possible to get pregnant a second time she had a miserable time carrying Saint That s my experience and I m not gonna pretend that it s not, The E reality star added I just don t think pregnancy and me really agree with each other, In the Apr episode of Kim spoke to Kourtney again about her surrogacy plans I m definitely leaning more towards I want to try she said After talking to Kanye I think I always knew that surrogacy was an option but I didn t think it was that realistic of an option and now I feel like that s my reality I feel like surrogacy really is the only other option for me Either way Kim would remain hopeful Whatever s meant to be will be, Kim previously about the hardships of her first pregnancy when she was diagnosed with early onset preeclampsia and had to deliver North at just weeks about six weeks early, At her doctor s insistence her labor was induced Kim s labor didn t come out as it should have and stayed attached inside my uterus which is a condition called placenta accreta she wrote This is a high risk condition that happens when the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall My doctor had to stick his entire arm in me and detach the placenta with his hand scraping it away from my uterus with his fingernails How disgusting and painful My mom was crying she had never seen anything like this before My delivery was fairly easy but then going through that it was the most painful experience of my life They gave me a second epidural but we were racing against time so I just had to deal, Kim later had to have surgery to remove a piece of the placenta followed by a second surgery to remove the remaining scar tissue This was all preventing me from getting pregnant the second time around she wrote I have amazing doctors that helped me through the entire process and I m so grateful I was able to conceive again Even so if she were to get pregnant a third time her risk of having preclampsia and placenta accreta will be higher than it was before, Given her upbringing is it any wonder Kim wants a big family I grew up with siblings she explained on in If I could just snap my fingers and have four I would have four, Neither Kim nor Kanye has publicly commented on the surrogacy news, FOMO no More, sign up now, success, Thank you for subscribing, we re sorry an error has occurred, U S, CA, U

BBC News Navigation, Spy poisoning UK plays down Russia complaint at plane search, Share this with, Email, Facebook, Messenger, Messenger, Twitter, Pinterest, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Copy this link, These are external links and will open in a new window, The UK has rejected a complaint from Russia over a search of one of its aircraft at London s Heathrow Airport as a row over the poisoning of a former Russian spy deepens, The British government described the search of the Aeroflot plane on Friday as routine after Russia suggested it was illegal, Dozens of diplomats have been expelled on both sides in the poisoning dispute, Moscow wants UK representation in Russia cut by a further diplomats, Twenty three had already been expelled by Russia in response to the UK s announcement of Russian expulsions on March, Ex spy Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia were poisoned on March in Salisbury with what UK investigators have concluded was a Russian nerve agent called Novichok Russian denies involvement, He is critically ill but stable while she is now said to be conscious and talking, The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has meanwhile said it will consider a request for Russian consular access to Yulia a Russian citizen, What happened on the plane, Aeroflot flight SU landed at Heathrow on Friday at local time, A man identified by Russian TV as pilot Vitaly Mitrofanov said he was confined to his cockpit by a team with a sniffer dog, The Border Force officers inspected the plane for up to three minutes before leaving with a thank you he added, The pilot maintains they gave no reasons for the inspection and he was not allowed to observe their actions or accompany them in their work, If there is no explanation the Russian side will deem the actions towards our plane as illegal and also reserve the right to take similar action against British airlines Russia s ministry of transport said in a statement, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dubbed the search a provocation so the British government could save its face in any possible way, How has the UK responded, UK Security Minister Ben Wallace said in a statement that it was routine for Border Force to search aircraft to protect the UK from organised crime and from those who attempt to bring harmful substances like drugs or firearms into the country, He added Once these checks were carried out the plane was allowed to carry on with its onward journey, Former chief executive of the UK Border Agency Rob Whiteman said intelligence would have been a factor, This incident with the Aeroflot flight at Heathrow being searched would have been a routine security search which the security services would have undertaken acting on intelligence he told the BBC, These searches are routine they don t happen every day but they do happen fairly regularly, What is the background to the latest dispute, The poisoning row has rumbled on for nearly a month, The UK is adamant Russia is behind the poisoning of the Skripals Russia denies it, Moscow has been taken aback by the strength of support for Britain by mainly Western countries who announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats over the course of three days earlier this week, Moscow responded in kind and then added to the number of British diplomats told to leave Russia, On Friday the British ambassador Laurie Bristow was told that the UK had a month to cut its diplomatic mission in Russia to the same size as the Russian mission in Britain, A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said The Russian response is regrettable but in light of Russia s previous behaviour we anticipated a response, However this doesn t change the facts of the matter the attempted assassination of two people on British soil for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday issued a warning over a situation that is similar to a large extent to what we lived during the Cold War, Russia singles out UK again, British diplomats left Moscow a week ago but ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned back to the foreign ministry for additional punishment, Beyond the issue of parity the Russian side hasn t really explained why it s made the latest demand, But it s clear that Russia sees Britain as the ringleader of an international conspiracy which resulted in the biggest mass expulsion of Russian diplomats in history, Britain s provocative and unjustified actions the ministry said had inspired the unfounded expulsion of Russian diplomats, It s a backhanded compliment to Prime Minister Theresa May who has successfully corralled a wider international coalition than anyone would have thought possible a month ago, Russia has railed against the British government over its efforts to internationalise what officials here call the so called Skripal affair The solidarity expressed by so many countries has been dismissed as a result of financial and political pressure orchestrated in tandem with the US, What is Russia s take on the expulsions, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so called Skripal case for the decision by dozens of countries to expel Russian diplomats, He reiterated Russian calls for consular access to Yulia Skripal a Russian citizen The UK Foreign Office says it is considering this in line with our obligations under international and domestic law including the rights and wishes of Yulia Skripal, Russia Mr Lavrov said was also seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons OPCW to establish the truth, Related Topics, Share this story, More on this story, Top Stories, Italy reacts

sisters Ray Wood s plan for his daughters aged nine and three, By Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent, Share this with, Under a blazing Brisbane sun and with coach Josh encouraging her to keep hands loose and legs set nine year old Livinnia Wood begins Wednesday morning training, Her father Ray offers words of support as he patrols the back of the court pointing out the occasional wolf spider and collecting in the balls, The year old who was born and raised in Liverpool is trying to create two of the greatest female tennis players the planet has ever seen, But his approach divides opinion, You might as well buy a lottery ticket is how tennis great Martina Navratilova sees it, Two years on Ray remains confident Livinnia and her three year old sibling Paloma can one day be like former world number ones Venus and Serena Williams as sisters who make it to the top of the world, You ve got to stay fit you ve got to stay healthy he said, Livi s going to go through the teenage years and has still got to be motivated to play and train, But I think if she gets over those hurdles world number one majors it s not easy but the more and more research I ve done I more than believe in that, The family s next step is likely to be a move to Spain to seek out a more competitive environment, Are champions born or made, Last year Livinnia won competitions at local and state level She sometimes plays against children five years her senior and spends between nine and hours a week on the tennis court and four to five hours on the running track, First off try put a little more pressure on these kids why don t you was time Grand Slam singles champion Navratilova s response when told about Ray s plans, And I really totally disagree with the idea that champions are made not born Champions are born and then they have to have the right environment to be made, If the girls are going to be ft in not going to happen Until I was about years old I played on average maybe four hours a week of tennis look where it got me, If everything goes really well one of them might get into the top but getting to number one You might as well buy a lottery ticket, The family spend between A and A a week to fund Livinnia s tennis which will of course increase when as has always been the plan her younger sister Paloma follows the same path, Ray who is a youth technical director for the Brisbane Roar football club also runs a business which offers sports based sessions to pre school children and has recently become an occasional Uber driver to make ends meet, A handful of local businesses contribute a small but not insignificant amount to the running costs and the Pacific Sports Management agency is in the process of exploring longer term options, Putting all the eggs into this one basket it puts a lot of pressure on the kids and I just hope they are happy doing what they are doing Navratilova said, I have seen this before with parents girls or boys are on the court three or four hours a day at a young age and it just doesn t end well They get burned out either mentally or physically, I wish him well but I would not be doing this with my kids Even if they wanted to be champions I would not be that hard headed about it, Location location location, Brisbane has been the family s home for more than half of Livinnia s life But the four of them will soon be moving on They will spend five weeks in Spain this summer sizing up tennis academies schools and job options with a view to moving there permanently in, The trip will also allow Livinnia to test herself in competition against European players of the same age, I think Livi for the next year or two is still going to get a challenge in Australia says Ray who will be looking for work in football having previously coached at Premier League side Leicester City and French giants Paris St Germain, But I think once she gets close to her teenage years there s a hell of a lot of the ITF and Futures events in Europe plus In Australia you re lucky if there s maybe a handful each year, We need to make sure we keep that environment where Livi is constantly struggling and developing rather than winning all the time Livi s been hitting on grass and hard courts for the past four or five years but as part of her plan and development she s got to do two to three years on the clay at some point, Ray says his Australian wife Angela is very supportive but what about Livinnia herself, I don t really know she said clutching the last of her raspberry and orange flavoured post training slushy, I would like to move there but I would really miss home because I have a lot of family members here so it s a bit hard to move, That is also a concern for Wim Fissette the successful WTA coach who has worked with Kim Clijsters Victoria Azarenka Simona Halep Johanna Konta and now Angelique Kerber He sees advantages in Europe but does not see a move as essential, Australia s a big country That s tough to understand for me he says, It s a choice but I don t think it s necessary We also have to think is the family happy because the kids now have a lot of friends in Australia Should they really move and start a new social life That s a difficult question because it will be very important the girls stay very happy in their life and they will need that in their career, Dad hands over coaching reins, In recent months Ray has handed over the bulk of the coaching duties to Josh Barrenechea who has a Spanish grandfather and seems open to the idea of joining the family in Europe, I love coaching and working with players like Liv and yeah wherever it takes me I think I d be willing to go on that journey he said, She soaks up all the information which is really good She s got a fantastic eye for the game she strikes the ball better than any eight or nine year old girl that I ve seen around here, Mindful of the tension which can exist between young players and their parents Andre Agassi has written of his difficult relationship with a father who was determined to turn him into a champion Ray seems content to take a backseat, I have learned over the past two years why you can have a lot of breakdowns with parents and children when you play tennis he said, It s very stressful and it can be very hard and I actually really enjoy sitting back on the sidelines picking up balls letting Josh do his work and not interfering, Project champion Part two, The youngest Wood daughter Paloma will begin regular tennis sessions in May when she turns four For the moment her father says she is out on court once or twice a week for about minutes at a time, We re just trying to get that little bit of intrinsic motivation from her and see if it s something she s going to want to crack on with Ray said, We ll start her on roughly four hours a week All fun based sessions balloons ribbons everything that Livi went through and then hopefully by the time she s eight or nine she ll have to get to the serious work of sweating and bleeding on the tennis court, Paloma is naturally right handed but Ray is intending to develop his daughter as a leftie That worked a treat for Rafael Nadal who writes and plays golf right handed, But Navratilova another great left hander strikes a note of caution, It is no bad thing she says to be able to serve with both hands but she recommends hitting other strokes with the predominant hand And in her experience those who do not serve with their naturally stronger hand tend to be the weaker servers, Is this fair on the girls, Ray says he will respect his daughters wishes if ever they decide this lifestyle is no longer for them, Livinnia says she would like to be a vet after retiring from professional tennis and says the training is not quite as enjoyable as it used to be, When I was younger it was probably a bit more fun but now I am older I have to work a bit harder in the heat Josh always pushes me to my top limits and I always get really tired and hot she said, Ray says he has no qualms about the route they have chosen for the girls, We want the girls to be role models for other children when they grow up he said, We want them to have foundations and charities I truly believe we re put on the world to do a job and my job is to be in and around the coaching industry and to develop my daughters into two sports stars so they can go on and help children who don t have an opportunity who don t have a mum or dad and who don t have enough money to put food on the table, Fissette thinks Ray is striking a good balance, From what I hear it s fine he said, I think because they go to school they have friends and also the way the father approaches this process he lets them do different kinds of sports to learn different skills He sees his role really as a dad so I think for sure he s helping the kids the right way, But of course when the kids get older they will have their own thoughts on how they see their life,

with the recent changes with GitHub, This has already been fixed for and will be available in the release version In the meantime as a workaround you can switch to using support Please note however that when using this option if your SSH keys are protected with a passphrase they need to be added at system level This is usually done by using a tool such as, We are also backporting the fix to with

Let s look together at what we all accomplished in and celebrate our common drive to create great software, For us for example there have been important announcements like we ve held our first ever

features we fixed bugs we participated in conferences to share what we know best and we learned a lot None of this would have been possible without the input from our community our users and the individuals within the company, What about you Did you learn a new programming language Did you create an awesome new project feature or open source library Did you have your first talk at a user group or a conference sharing what you know best Did you fix an extremely complex issue and save the universe Did you reproduce that bug when no one else could Each milestone big or small they all

without switching contexts Our IDEs also put a pretty face on sometimes cryptic Git commands while preserving the power of high end versioning productivity, GitHub is with JetBrains Developer Advocate Paul Everitt on to show GitHub and IntelliJ Platform IDEs working together to make collaboration around source code easier The webinar will give a brief introduction to the GitHub Flow of branch based pull request development as seen through JetBrains IDEs We ll clone repositories pull updates commit changes create pull requests and other features of JetBrains Git and GitHub integration minutes of demonstration followed by minutes of Q A, Join us to see how you can be even more productive with GitHub and JetBrains IDEs, Yesterday we released the newest member to our family of IDEs an IDE for Go language Additionally this week we have also released major updates to many of our other tools including IntelliJ IDEA WebStorm CLion PyCharm and more, Some of our users who upgraded their corresponding IDE to the released version have noticed that the Go plugin is no longer available which may have come as a surprise We d like to explain why this has happened and the reasons behind it, First and foremost this is not a recent change nor is it related to the release of GoLand this week Over a month ago we mentioned in one of the that the Go plugin would no longer be available in future EAPs and releases of IDEs other than IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate The reason behind this as outlined in the post is that this aligns with our general IDE approach PyCharm for Python RubyMine for Ruby etc and GoLand for Go, It seems that by not having disabled the Go plugin in other IDEs from the start of the EAP program and by not having communicated this properly to a wider audience when the change was made the current situation has come as somewhat of a surprise to some of our users, We failed and we sincerely apologize for this Rest assured however that it was never our intention to mislead anybody It was though an oversight on our part in how we presented it The plugin was never shipped out of the box nor enabled by default in any of our IDEs, To reiterate it was always in the plan to have Go plugin functionality available as part of the GoLand IDE If you want Go functionality combined with other technologies then IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is the right choice for you much like in the case of the other technologies such as Ruby Python PHP etc, Once again please accept our apologies for not communicating the change clearly enough, Please welcome Toolbox App the biggest update since the initial release one year ago In this build you ll find an auto update option improvements for the projects list and a refreshed user interface, Auto update, Now in every installed tool s settings there is an option to enable automatic downloading and installing of newer versions There is also a similar option available for Toolbox App itself in the main settings Enable it to always use the latest available goodies and not have to wait an extra second, To ensure this feature works properly we ve improved the reliability of downloads on poor connections Toolbox App now correctly reacts to network timeouts and resumes the download after a connection is reestablished, If for some reason you don t like the recent version that was installed automatically you can always roll back This action will revert the latest update and remember to skip that version next time The Skip action is also available in the tool s menu if you decide to stick to manual upgrades If you click it by accident you still can force the skipped version to be installed from the same menu, Please note that auto update is disabled by default and should be activated for each tool individually On Windows and newer auto update is disabled on metered connections per Microsoft guidelines, We encourage you to enable auto update for all installed tools and let us know how it works for you, Improved projects list, There is a new context menu on every project in Toolbox from which you can, and, The projects list is now updated more often and more efficiently too meaning it always stays up to date while consuming fewer resources, A custom project icon is now detected as well You can set it from an IDE s Welcome screen or via the Manage Projects dialog or just add an file in the directory in the project root, Also if your IDE configs are stored in a non default directory Toolbox App will pick up on this and correctly detect and show all your projects, Firefox extension for integration with GitHub, A browser extension for easy opening of GitHub projects is now available in the Previously it was only available for Google Chrome, Refreshed UI, To celebrate Toolbox App s first birthday we ve slightly refreshed its UI Check it out, Compatibility notes, On Linux Toolbox App now requires version This means it will no longer start on older distributions like CentOS or Ubuntu Their support period has come to an end and we ve stopped releasing new builds for them in order to focus on better support for modern distributions If you re staying on those platforms you re welcome to use Toolbox App updates for installed applications will continue to work as before, This release also fixes an issue with blank window which we ve been able to reproduce on some configurations with the latest graphics cards drivers on Linux We are still investigating some issues with Wayland though, As usual many smaller fixes and improvements are included See the for details, Update now from the app or download and let us know what you think of the new features, Spend more time coding less updating, Your JetBrains Toolbox App Team, As you may recall in early we at JetBrains ran the massive Developer Ecosystem survey to better understand developers and their needs all around the world, In July we finished analyzing the collected data and published the most interesting findings in these, Now as we promised we re sharing the raw data for the survey so that anyone in the developer community can analyze the results and answer whatever questions they have in mind, Before digging deeper into these data please note the following important information, Once again we d like to thank everyone who took part in our research You helped a lot, We plan to repeat the survey next year Don t

Lashes Out Over Convention in Defense of Hilarie Burton, , Chris Polk FilmMagic, shall not be messed with, The year old actress took to today posting a lengthy message in response to those attacking her former co star for stating that she will not be attending an upcoming EyeCon convention, I m sorry Mary I will not be attending any EyeCon events Ever Burton to a fan I personally feel exploited by their girl power angle which exists at the expense of some of us who went through a difficult time on that show They re using our sisterhood as a sales gimmick No thanks, Following her tweet multiple members from EyeCon responded to the star on Twitter which the organization then re tweeted from their official account, Photos, is my sister Don t fuck with her Period Pt, The WB Fred Norris, HilarieBurton Girl Power Angle WOW I m part of the Eyecon company made up of mostly women and I m on that ME TOO list You know nothing about US or the women who help me get out of bed ever day so I can find myself again one member, Girl Power isn t an angle it s a way of life I am proud to work for a company that is made up of mostly women I am proud to be part of a company that puts smiles on people s faces I am proud to be part of EyeCon another, After seeing the backlash from the EyeCon organization Bush quickly came to her friend s defense Hilarie Burton is my sister Don t f k with her Period she wrote along with a lengthy supportive message, As E News showrunner was accused of sexual harassment by cast and crew members in an open letter published in November In addition cast members including Bush Burton and expressed their support for their former colleague who also accused Schwahn of sexual harassment, Read Bush s in support of Burton below, Let s get real clear real quick Hilarie Burton is my sister She is a big hearted brilliant thoughtful incredible human She has had laser sharp clearly defined integrity running up her spine as long as I have known her, She is a human being She has feelings She is entitled to her OWN OPINIONS She does not make statements hastily She didn t say something about a business situation and the way that it was handled that was based on emotion not logic And the fact that a business organization would DARE to say such a thing has a fire burning in me, So let s get brutally honest You want to throw a women s empowerment event but bash a woman who said that the way it s been handled doesn t feel good to her A woman whose personal victimization took the world s stage this past fall Whose sisterhood circled around her and each other to see to it that he be stopped from treating other women in such a way How Dare You, Want to know why Hil said she feels exploited by this empowerment con Well add my name to that hat Because so do I We told our stories As a united front We refused to let it get tabloidy and gross And then suddenly a convention publicly announced that they want to empower women Now that would have been FINE lovely even IF THEY HAD SPOKEN TO US ABOUT THIS Had they called our reps and said as fellow victims in our own individual ways we want to make the next con all about women and raise money for women s charities They did not Let me repeat They Did NOT They didn t ask a single one of us if we d feel okay focusing a convention which is dedicated to the show on which many of us were harassed or abused behind the scenes around those very issues and thus offer an expectation to all fans and attendees that we would be discussing these past violations and focusing on issues that none of us want to be forced to relive in meet and greets and photo sessions They made an announcement without thinking of any of the women of One Tree Hill for a second And now they are defending themselves by saying that Mark took advantage of them too That he ruined their ability to watch a show which felt like their safe space Well it HAPPENED to us, They are also now saying that because they too have stories from their own lives they couldn t have possibly pounced on the business opportunity of capitalizing on our experiences And my heart breaks for their past pain But those painful realities are not mutually exclusive from a clear business opportunity None of those deeply personal experiences of the women behind the scenes of this event will be asked about in Q As None of those women will be asked to expand in front of an audience about what MeToo means to them None of those women will have their past be made fair game fodder without their EXPRESS PERMISSION and CONSENT Any of us who has spoken about this in interviews on panels at conferences has been ASKED FIRST They did not ask us They announced a deeply personal theme and intention which revolves in this context around what all OTH fans know happened to us without thinking about us at all And forgive me if it now feels like the claim of charity fundraising is being made to cover this up For example they cited Ian doing a con to raise money for his charity That didn t just happen It was PLANNED Where was our opportunity to plan any such fundraiser prior to this announcement being made and the expectation that because of the theme we would all just be on board, Don t even get me started on the reality which I know for a FACT that multiple women reported a male guest at these conventions behaving inappropriately and this organization did NOTHING He was invited back multiple times until more than one of us women was alerted and then jointly said expressly that we would never do another con if he were present Again FACT, So Yes This feels exploitative Yes this feels like a violation And the fact that a business would behave in such a childish and offensive manner as to incite the bashing of an actress sharing her personal opinion about her feelings the fact that they would stoop so low as to retweet hateful messages about her or pit victims against one another I ve seen fans attacking each other over whose abuse is worse This is revolting REVOLTING To shame a woman and say she s emotional not logical I thought that kind of bullsh t was reserved for mansplaining And low and behold it s being done by women How dare you Here s me being logical listing out facts and your failures to behave professionally with both your statements and your backend communications with us Here s me ALSO expressing my emotions of anger and disgust and saying that I m out You won t be seeing me there I wasn t going to attend because I too felt icky about the theme given the complete lack of conversation about it But now Nah You came for my sister That s the most anti women support women action I ve seen So yeah This is me officially saying I m out too, U S, CA, U K, AU, DE, FR, U S, E Is

Mourning, Site Search Navigation, Site Navigation, Site Mobile Navigation, Advertisement, An Online Generation Redefines Mourning, In when Rebecca Soffer s father died of a heart attack on a cruise to the the condolence notes came pouring in many in the form of text messages I got so many from very good friends Ms Soffer said from the couch of her Upper West Side apartment not long ago They said they were sorry or how r u, Text message was also the preferred medium of a something who asked a funeral home in to text him a picture of his mother s corpse to help him avoid having to go in and identify the body Caitlin Doughty a director at the funeral home at the time said in a phone interview that she initially thought No I m not going to send you a text of your mother s corpse but as someone who believes in interacting with the reality of death as intentionally as possible I thought a text was better than nothing, Ms Doughty is an undertaker and the founder of a website about mortality The funeral home which had never before received such a request asked the son to sign a form saying he understood the emotional distress that might result from the photo before sending it, The social norms for loss and the Internet are clearly still evolving But Gen Y ers and millennials have begun projecting their own sensibilities onto rituals and discussions surrounding death As befits the first generation of digital natives they are starting blogs series and feeds about grief loss and even the macabre bringing the conversation about bereavement and the deceased into a very public forum sometimes with jarring results, Advertisement, Last November to give the topic a generationally specific space Ms Soffer and Gabrielle Birkner started a website geared to people around their age to address many permutations of loss from to a parent s death Both women have confronted the latter Four years before Ms Soffer s father s heart attack her mother was killed in a car accident And in Ms Birkner s father and stepmother were murdered at their home in Ariz by a methamphetamine addict, Advertisement, Ms Soffer and Ms Birkner found the emotional and psychological support resources for people in their early adult life stage lacking I went to a family of homicide victims support group run through Safe Horizons in a church basement in when I was living on the Upper West Side and there was no one in my generation said Ms Birkner a based writer and editor Still it did save my life Ms Soffer said she was the only person under at the grief support groups she joined adding that among those her own age I barely know anyone who had lost both their parents, For a generation known for broadcasting internal monologue across the Internet some of its members seem eager for spaces to express not just the good stuff that litters everyone s newsfeed but also the painful In November Melissa Lafsky Wall the founder of New York based Brick Wall Media turned to Modern Loss after a miscarriage posting an essay called The Silent Sorrow The Internet should speak to the parts of life that we all experience but aren t represented in most media a large one being grief and loss Ms Wall said adding that the feedback she got was all positive which she attributes to the site If you are going to write about your miscarriage on Reddit for instance it s going to be a very different community, Modern Loss is a repository of essays resources and advice that the founders try to edit so that it doesn t sound glib overly religious or trite For instance you ll never hear At least they are in a better place Our least favorite line ever Ms Soffer said The website also examines decidedly st century topics like what to do when Gmail keeps suggesting someone who has died as a contact a topic that Esther D Kustanowitz the founder of the blog My Urban Kvetch explored in a post called Deleting My Mother Befitting the target audience it is not overly earnest Stay tuned for upcoming Modern Loss events in real life the site s about us page says Because misery loves company and nachos And margaritas, Ms Soffer a former producer at The Colbert Report said of the site You have to have a sense of humor, Another mourning site speaking to the younger generation is promising s Music st Century Grief Its founder Zoe Feldman solicits essays about human loss sorry no pets sending her contributors a mix tape in return for submitting an essay about a human loss they have experienced Named after the company Lisa Frank known for its brightly colored products that Ms Feldman said are to her the antithesis of grief the venture was inspired after her former girlfriend and classmate Rebecca Rosenthal known as Becca died in October at age, I went to a Shaman a healer and every psychiatrist in Manhattan and the only thing that helped me was talking to people my age who had experienced some devastating loss said Ms Feldman who works on business strategy for in New York and has mailed around mixtape cassettes she will burn a CD for those who don t have a tape player One person wrote and said it s like being part of a weird sad tribe she said, Those who are accustomed to social media as a way to tout how fabulous your life is beware these sites can be unflinchingly graphic and wrenching In November K H submitters use their initials on Lisa Frank Mixtape wrote My dad passed away on May in my arms as I tried to give him, Ms Doughty the author of a forthcoming book Smoke Gets In Your Eyes And Other Lessons From the Crematory to be published by in September said she is seeing a cultural shift happening around what she calls death awareness Her peers are engaging in more open and public discussions about mortality and loss a movement of which her channel on YouTube is on the frontier, Advertisement, The series has received over a million views since fielding questions such as How do you become a mortician Go to mortuary school and Can you bake cremated remains into a chocolate cake Yes but it s kind of gross On Ms Doughty s blog contributors discuss issues like What do dead bodies really look like and Suicide is the cause of death Do you share, Meanwhile the show about young people making their way in modern day Brooklyn has twice tackled the issue of grief and death this season first when Hannah Horvath s e book editor David is found dead in the Hudson River Do you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive Ms Horvath asks her editor s widow at his funeral She promptly tells Hannah using an expletive to leave the reception the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season when her grandmother dies, Newsletter Sign

try again later, You are already subscribed to this email, The show also highlighted how the Internet has made grief more public and casual and therefore more fraught Why aren t you mourning quietly asks Adam Hannah s boyfriend after she reads him a part of her editor s obituary on Gawker which in real life has a tag called And Now They re Dead responses to death like the hashtag RIP which was widely used after the news of the fashion designer s suicide can also seem more like display than distress, Ms Birkner a former obituary writer said It s not the nature of social media generally to react thoughtfully to things and think How can I really help It would be great if everyone said Can I buy your groceries or can I start a meal train, Last February on what would have been Ms Rosenthal s th birthday Ms Feldman found a long post on her dead friend s Facebook wall from another friend speculating about how Ms Rosenthal had died A lot of what she wrote wasn t true Ms Feldman said Becca s mother was so upset and I spent the whole day trying to do crisis management Ms Feldman s explanation for that kind of behavior is performative grief she said adding That s the only excuse I can think of The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self indulgent look at me behavior On the other hand Ms Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long forgotten death anniversaries, It s such a push pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others said Heather Servaty Seib a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology the study of death and dying with an emphasis on adolescent grief, Then there s the lingua franca of social media the like button that s totally discordant with death My God is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing people like this underneath Ms Soffer said Facebook floated the idea of a sympathize button something that came out of its annual hackathon but has no plans to pursue it according to the company Facebook does offer an option to memorialize an account that prevents anyone from logging into it in the future but allows friends and family depending on privacy setting to leave posts on the timeline, The fact that the Internet is perhaps not the best channel for grief with gaffes immortalized in cyberspace is why David Fajgenbaum the founder of National Students of AMF a support network for college students with sick or deceased parents said his organization of chapters on campuses has been cautious about integrating an online component Someone could say the wrong thing online and could really hurt someone said Mr Fajgenbaum who started the support group in his mother s memory while an undergraduate at Georgetown, Advertisement, Miss Manners a k a Judith Martin writes rather unequivocally on the matter Letters of condolence should be written by hand she said Burdensome as it may be it offers the comfort of knowing that one is representing the deceased to those who cared about him, But as Mr Fajgenbaum acknowledged young people are eager for that virtual connection after all technology and the Internet are a ubiquitous part of their existence That s what Jason Feifer creator of the instantly viral Tumblr Selfies at Funerals discovered when he posted a few dozen photos of teenagers taking pictures of themselves at funerals In doing so Mr Feifer an editor at Fast Company magazine said he was documenting a newfangled mourning practice It s important for the older generation to see more than disrespect and to see some kind of genuine communication he said, Admittedly though some of the images made him cringe in particular the young woman who wrote Love my hair today Hate why I m dressed up funeral, Mr Feifer said I think there are a lot of kids who saw this Tumblr and will not take a selfie at a funeral but it doesn t mean that the kids who did take these photos don t know how to grieve, A version of this article appears in print on March on Page ST of the with the headline A Generation Redefines Mourning, We re interested in your feedback

on a quantum leap in computing, Share this with, Email, Facebook, Messenger, Messenger, Twitter, Pinterest, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Copy this link, These are external links and will open in a new window, In a laboratory in Copenhagen scientists believe they are on the verge of a breakthrough that could transform computing, A team combining Microsoft researchers and Niels Bohr Institute academics is confident that it has found the key to creating a quantum computer, If they are right then Microsoft will leap to the front of a race that has a tremendous prize the power to solve problems that are beyond conventional computers, In the lab are a series of white cylinders which are fridges cooled almost to absolute zero as part of the process of creating a qubit the building block of a quantum computer, This is colder than deep space it may be the coldest place in the universe Prof Charlie Marcus tells me, The team he leads is working in collaboration with other labs in the Netherlands Australia and the United States in Microsoft s quantum research programme, Right now they are behind in the race the likes of Google IBM and a Silicon Valley start up called Rigetti have already shown they can build systems with as many as qubits Microsoft has yet to demonstrate in public at least that it can build one, But these scientists are going down a different route from their rivals trying to create qubits using a subatomic particle whose existence was first suggested back in the s by an Italian physicist Ettore Majorana, This week scientists from Microsoft s laboratory in Delft published outlining the progress they had made in isolating the Majorana particle, Their belief is that this will lead to a much more stable qubit than the methods their rivals are using which are highly prone to errors That should mean scaling up to a fully operational quantum computer will be far easier, At the Copenhagen lab they showed me through a powerful microscope the tiny wire where they have created these Majorana particles Later over dinner Prof Charlie Marcus tried not altogether successfully to demonstrate to someone whose last physics exam was more than years ago what was unique about this approach with three pieces of bread and some cutlery, What s really astounding with this activity compared with what everybody else is doing is that we have to invent a particle that s never existed before and then use it for computing he explains, It s a profoundly more exotic challenge than what s going on with other approaches to quantum computing, Other scientists taking those other approaches are looking on with great interest and a little scepticism, It s one of those things that on paper look incredibly exciting but physics has a habit of throwing up spanners in the works says University College London s Prof John Morton whose research involves using good old fashioned silicon to build qubits, Until we see the demonstration we don t know how well these Majorana qubits developed by Microsoft will really behave, He says this is a big year for the field with the strong likelihood that Google or IBM will demonstrate what is known as quantum supremacy where a problem that is beyond a conventional supercomputer is solved using quantum methods, But Microsoft seems confident that its years of research will soon pay off, We will have a commercially relevant quantum computer one that s solving real problems within five years says Dr Julie Love Microsoft s director of quantum computing business development, She is already out selling the company s customers a vision of a near future where quantum computers will help battle climate change create new superconducting materials and super charge machine learning, What it allows us to do is solve problems that with all of our supercomputers running in parallel would take the lifetime of the universe to solve in seconds hours or days, So the heat is on for the research team Prof Charlie Marcus who spent most of his career at Harvard before being recruited to run the Copenhagen lab says his life has been about creating knowledge not building products, My job is to find out what works and hand it off to the engineers and computer scientists who will turn it into a technology, Heading up the whole programme is Todd Holmdahl the Microsoft executive previously in charge of the Hololens mixed reality headset and the Xbox games console a measure of how serious the company is about making some quantum hardware pretty soon, I pressed Prof Marcus on whether his team was going to hit that ambitious five year target set by his employer, We re sure going to try he says with a grin, Related Topics, Share this story, Top Stories, Tributes led by actor Eddie Redmayne are paid at the funeral

Clinton There Are No Great Generations Just Different Problems, Most Popular, Reuters Pool New, The office where I met Clinton high in the UN headquarters building belongs to another era It is an institution built for a world of the past one based on Cold War rivalries and the last century s balance of power It was Clinton s first day in the cramped space and his entourage of bodyguards and assistants were stumbling over one another in the confines The Secret Service men dispatched a young press aide to inquire why so many UN staffers were loitering near the elevators though it was clear that they were simply trying to catch a glimpse of the ex president, Is this the office an exhausted Clinton asked after shaking my hand I nodded as did most of the swarm that followed him The entire place felt as if it hadn t been touched since the early fifties when the building was raised a lone skyscraper above an otherwise flat block on the East Side of Manhattan I heard him chuckle to a staffer as he stepped inside You know what wahut the final word came out It kinda reminds me of Mad Men Have you seen that show yet, Couples Speak Honestly About Open Relationships, Non monogamous couples speak candidly about the challenges and rewards of their unconventional lifestyle, About the Author, Most Popular, Donald Trump Doesn t Understand Community Colleges, In a speech on Thursday he revealed he doesn t appreciate the vital role they play in the country s education system and economy, During a speech on Thursday President Trump revealed a striking ignorance of one of the pillars of his country s educational system In the course of promoting his infrastructure plan he a bit perplexingly dismissed the country s community colleges suggesting he doesn t know what purpose they serve We do not know what a community college means he told the crowd in an Ohio training facility for construction apprentices moments after expressing nostalgia for the vocational schools that flourished when he was growing up schools that offered hands on training in fields such as welding and cosmetology, He seemed to have a better grasp on these latter schools analogizing them to the apprenticeship programs he was promoting in his effort to create high paying infrastructure jobs The implication as he brushed aside one form of higher education and lauded another was that he d like to resuscitate short term training opportunities and phase out community colleges in the name of workforce development, The Americanization of an Ancient Faith, The year old Coptic Church is trying something new spreading its message across the United States and the rest of the world, One day in the fall of Father Anthony Messeh then a priest at the St Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in Fairfax Virginia sat down with a list of names There were individuals all American converts with no Egyptian heritage who had been baptized at the church since his arrival in Of the group only eight were still active members, That just broke my heart Messeh told me one afternoon last summer If one or two people had left then maybe I could say it was something wrong with them But if out of had left that meant it s something wrong with me, One American couple who d left the congregation told him that while the church felt like a family it didn t feel like family St Mark s like many of the over Coptic churches in the United States is overwhelmingly comprised of Copts raised in Egypt or born to Egyptian parents Of the nearly members of the church most still converse comfortably in Arabic and the services retain Egyptian cultural norms Men and women tend to sit separately people move around freely during prayers and Egyptian food is often served, The Case Against High School Sports, The United States routinely spends more tax dollars per high school athlete than per high school math student unlike most countries worldwide And we wonder why we lag in international education rankings, thousands of teenagersmove to the United States from all over the world for all kinds of reasons They observe everything in their new country with fresh eyes including basic features of American life that most of us never stop to consider, One element of our education system consistently surprises them Sports are a big deal here says Jenny who moved to America from South Korea with her family in Shawnee High her public school in southern New Jersey fields teams in sports over the course of the school year including golf and bowling Its campus has lush grass fields six tennis courts and an athletic Hall of Fame They have days when teams dress up in Hawaiian clothes or pajamas just because We re the soccer team Jenny says To protect the privacy of Jenny and other students in this story only their first names are used, Chicago s Awful Divide, Americans are flocking to big cities to find good jobs opportunities that remain disproportionately out of reach for the poorest residents already living there, CHICAGO Americans hear a lot these days about the country s urban rural divide Rural counties are poorer urban ones richer Rural areas are losing jobs urban ones are gaining them People with a college education are leaving rural areas They re moving to urban places, Behind this divergence lies a straightforward story The twin forces of globalization and technological change are a handful of big urban areas while resources are drained from the heartland leaving it often devoid of opportunity and prosperity But this neat division rural versus urban erases another part of the story of America s changing economy the pressure that those twin forces are exerting within cities pulling some people up to the very top while pushing others to an unforgiving bottom In some prosperous cities such as Chicago where the number of has grown fourfold since people at the bottom are struggling as much as they always have if not more illustrating that it s not just the white rural poor who are being left behind in today s economy The disconnect is why Andrew Diamond the author of has called Chicago a combination of Manhattan smashed against Detroit, The Diet That Might Cure Depression, Several studies show that healthy eating is connected with better mood, At the turn of the th century prominent physicians who were trying to understand where mental illness comes from seized on a new theory autointoxication Intestinal microbes these doctors suggested are actually dangerous to their human hosts They fatigue melancholia and the neuroses as a historical article in the journal recounts, The control of man s diet is readily accomplished but mastery over his intestinal bacterial flora is not a doctor named Bond Stow in the in The innumerable examples of autointoxication that one sees in his daily walks in life is proof thereof malaise total lack of ambition so that every effort in life is a burden mental depression often bordering upon melancholia, The Ball Is Very Much in the Russian Court, Avoiding another Cold War may require Moscow to change course, On Thursday it was Americans who learned they were being kicked out of Russia On Friday it was Europeans Russia s Foreign Ministry of several European nations and ordered the expulsion of their diplomats their number precisely mirrored the number of Russian diplomats expelled by Western nations on Monday In all nations expelled Russians over the past week in response to Moscow s alleged role in the by nerve agent of Sergei Skripal a former Russian spy and his daughter Yulia in the U K The U S expelled by far the highest number of Russians and Moscow responded in kind The U K expelled and faced similar retaliation, The Last Temptation, How evangelicals once culturally confident became an anxious minority seeking political protection from the least traditionally religious president in living memory, about our current politics really one of the most extraordinary developments of recent political history is the loyal adherence of religious conservatives to Donald Trump The president won of white evangelical Christians This was a higher level of support than either Ronald Reagan or George W Bush an outspoken evangelical himself ever received, Trump s background and beliefs could hardly be more incompatible with traditional Christian models of life and leadership Trump s past political stances he once supported the right to partial birth abortion his character he has bragged about sexually assaulting women and even his language he introduced the words and into presidential discourse would more naturally lead religious conservatives toward exorcism than alliance This is a man who has cruelly publicized his infidelities made disturbing sexual comments about his elder daughter and boasted about the size of his penis on the debate stage His lawyer reportedly arranged a payment to a porn star to dissuade her from disclosing an alleged affair Yet religious conservatives who once blanched at PG public standards now yawn at such NC maneuvers We are a long way from, Immigrants Give America a Foreign Policy Advantage, History proves they can help the U S keep other countries in check, It has often been thought that the composition of the American public consisting as it does of immigrants from so many lands is a vulnerability in foreign policy that for example German immigrants would harbor affinities for their land of origin and become disloyal during the world wars The argument was taken to a shameful extreme with the internment of Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor What has received less attention is the extent to which America s immigrant fabric can be a foreign policy advantage even a threat to other countries That is what British Prime Minister Palmerston feared and what President Lincoln stoked to forestall British recognition of the Confederacy during the Civil War The result was an important inhibition on Great Britain then the most powerful state of the international order, Unpacking the Fictional Japan of, Wes Anderson s film uses elements of the country s language and culture to create a fraught sense of unfamiliarity, One of the best sequences in Wes Anderson s new stop motion film is of a sushi chef preparing a boxed lunch In a bird s eye shot we see the chef s hands pin a still living fish chop off its head and tail set it to the side in a shallow bowl and fillet the carcass A wriggling octopus leg is held deftly cut into neat rectangles and pressed onto handfuls of vinegar rice The chef dots vivid green wasabi on each slice of octopus arranging the sushi carefully in a lacquered bento box This beautifully executed sequence is identical to the process so many sushi undertake as they stand behind counters performing for hungry audiences It is also the only scene in that needs to be set in Japan, Couples Speak Honestly About Open Relationships, Non monogamous couples speak candidly about the challenges and rewards of their unconventional lifestyle, The President Sang Amazing Grace, Joan Baez performs the mournful song in a new animated video that remembers Obama s visit to Charleston, Failure A Modern Success Story, An altruistic entrepreneur is forced to redefine his goals in the face of a life altering health condition, Why Are So Many Women Dying From Pregnancy in D C, The

news education and information services, Follow The Sun, Your Sun, Editions, The Sun, News Corp, Services, Fantasy football tips transfers you HAVE to make this weekend, And there s a number of tasty fixtures to sink your teeth into this weekend notably Man City s clash with Everton that could see them go one step closer with a win and Chelsea s huge match against Spurs on Sunday evening, Have you signed up to play Dream Team Weekender, But with all that and more in mind who should you be picking for your Dream Team this weekend, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Pope must be in dreamland after his England call up and even though he didn t make an appearance for the Three Lions in their two friendlies the experience must ve been priceless, He ll be back between the sticks for Burnley this weekend as they face pretty much already relegated West Brom at the Hawthorns, Still cheap as chips on Dream Team and one of the best goalkeepers on the game we implore you to sign him ahead of the end of the season push, The best defender to pick for Dream Team this season and a price to boot Otamendi will go into City s clash with Everton on the back of a mixed bag for Argentina, He snatched a goal for his nation in their friendly with Spain but shipped six in a humiliating defeat, They ll be no such scoreline against the Toffees on Saturday and we re sure he ll be fired up for City s march towards the title, Duly the second best defender on Dream Team the Spaniard has been one of the most consistent points scorers this season and is by far one of Chelsea s stand out players, He ll be key for them in their derby with Spurs on Sunday having been the Blues hero at Wembley in August when he scored both goals in their win, We could talk about Mohamed Salah until we re blue in the face but what about his fellow speedy Liverpool winger, The Senegal international hasn t been able to match his Reds teammate in terms of goals this season but is still one of their most eye catching attacking options and could give Crystal Palace a lot to think about on Saturday especially if they re focusing all of their defensive energy on Salah, Another Chelsea star who likes to be a thorn in the side for Spurs Willian has been exceptional for the Blues in recent weeks with his performance against Barcelona still fresh in the memory, He s still quite reasonable too at m compared to fellow midfielders Riyad Mahrez m and Raheem Sterling m and loves to torment their cross city rivals, He netted twice in their FA Cup semi final showdown last season and could be on target yet again here, Having scored the only goal of the game in Brazil s triumph over Germany Jesus will be full ofn Easter cheer this bank holiday weekend, And with Sergio Aguero pulling out of international duty with injury the youngster could be first choice at Goodison on Saturday, Still the most picked player on fantasy football this term Lukaku returns to club football having notched two goals and an assist in Belgium s midweek win over Saudi Arabia, He s been in fine form for United recently too and could make easy work of Swansea, , Fantasy football tips Game Week, The Liverpool goalie has silenced the haters in recent weeks pulling off a string of eye catching saves that have kept him in the back pages for all the right reasons, He didn t stand a chance against Marcus Rashford last weekend but he ll certainly fancy himself against Watford, Especially considering he s kept five clean sheets in his last eight league games, Much like his goalkeeper centre back van Dijk has been in fine form in recent weeks as the Reds have seemingly fixed their dodgy defence, He s picked up Dream Team points in his last five appearances and has been the catalyst of Liverpool s upturn in fortunes since arriving in January, Much like their London rivals Chelsea more on them shortly Spurs will be desperate for some FA Cup glory to make up for their early Champions League exit, So expect an all guns a blazing approach against Swansea in their early FA Cup clash on Saturday, And you can bet your life they ll want to avoid replay in the competition, We re putting our neck out a bit here because Willian has played lately, And with good reason as he s been Chelsea s best player in recent weeks Starring in the draw with Barcelona a fortnight ago and having possibly the only meaningful chance against the Catalan giants in their midweek return, Up against Leicester in the Cup he ll fancy another start ahead of Pedro, Crikey he s got pricey, If you don t have the Liverpool star in your Dream Team by now then you re doing it wrong, He s got a grand total of points on the game so far this season and with Harry Kane out until April he could go on to be our top points scorer, Man United will want to quickly forget about their midweek Champions League knockout and push on with their league and FA Cup campaigns, The runners up spot is their main target now while their Cup game at home to Brighton this weekend is a good chance to put a positive spin on their sorry week, It s not really worked out for this fella at Leicester so far this season but he s still got a great record in the FA Cup netting four times ahead of their clash with Chelsea this weekend He also scored and assisted in the win over West Brom last week so he s certainly got the taste for goals, , , Fantasy football tips Game Week, Liverpool s No has been a Dream Team favourite in recent weeks and why not, The German has been in fine form since breaking back into the first team at the start of the year overseeing six clean sheets and making a number of quality saves notably against Southampton and Newcastle, THAT Karius save vs from all angles, Liverpool FC LFC, He faces a rather different test on Saturday with the Reds taking on their North West rivals Man United, Will he continue his fine form and shut out the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Anthony Martial, Duffy s been a big part of Brighton s excellent debut season in the Premier League and was one of the heroes in their win over Arsenal last week, But less than of Dream Team managers have picked this guy despite his bargain price and respectable haul of points which beats the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Andrew Robertson, Burnley have been filled to the brim with fantasy football favourites this season including the likes of Nick Pope James Tarkowski and Robbie Brady, And it seems we ve unearthed another in the form of Lowton, REACTION Matthew Lowton shares his delight with a Man Of The Match performance against Everton Watch, Burnley FC BurnleyOfficial, The right back was in fine form in the win over Everton last time out and will definitely fancy his chances against an out of form West Ham at the weekend, I mean who else, If you don t have Salah in your Dream Team by now then you re doing it wrong, The Egyptian has hit goals in all competitions this season and could prove to be the difference against United on Saturday who we imagine will set up rather defensively to keep this lively Liverpool team out, Raheem Sterling s recent injury has been a blessing for Silva who s had a good run in Man City s first team lately, And goals against Chelsea and Arsenal in recent encounters have made this guy a sudden favourite on Dream Team, Amazing team performance today so proud to be part of this group th straight league win at the Etihad and it was great to score in front of the home fans again C mon, Bernardo Silva BernardoCSilva, Get him in ahead of their Monday night clash at Stoke we reckon, Spurs form man lately the South Korean notched a tasty points in the last Gamweek more than anyone else, A goal against Juventus in their unfortunate midweek defeat and two against Huddersfield means we re certain this guy will get a run out against Bournemouth on Sunday while he could be a regular in the side in the run up to the season s climax, The Chelsea new boy will relish the chance to start against Crystal Palace this weekend having scored that beautiful scorpion goal against them last year with Arsenal, The Frenchman was initially signed as a back up option for the struggling Alvaro Morata but it looks as though he could force his way into the team ahead of the former Real Madrid striker, Fantasy football tips Game Week, It s an exciting time for Spurs fans, The North London side face Huddersfield at home this weekend straight off the back of their midweek demolition of lowly Rochdale in the FA Cup before their decisive Champions League clash against Juventus on Wednesday, And quietly Lloris has been brilliant and a big part of their recent good form, The French goalkeeper is safely ranked third place among the goalkeepers on Dream Team this season two guesses who the other two are and will be relishing some of the more straight forward fixtures this month against Bournemouth and Newcastle in the coming weeks, We love a bargain here at Dream Team so of course we had to include this guy, Eight points in Gameweek for Holebas thanks to Watford s win over Everton is a great haul to bring with you to a home clash against bottom of the lot West Brom on Saturday, More impressively the full back has seemingly got to grips with a fairly unfamiliar central role in defence lately notably performing well in the win over Chelsea last month, He ll certainly been keen to face a Baggies side that have been woeful of late losing five times on the bounce, Can someone get us a towel, Sane has been mouth wateringly good this season and was excellent against Arsenal on Thursday causing the Gunners defence all kinds of problems, He picked up points in Gameweek to add to his tally of so far this season and he could again pull of the moves against Chelsea on Sunday, He s definitely your favourite West Ham player so why not give him a run in your Dream Team this weekend, The versatile winger has been an instant hit at the London Stadium since returning from injury notching a goal and an assist in his last two appearances He could be key in their fight for survival as the season winds down, Plenty of folks have been sticking this guy in lately and why not, A stunning three goals in his last three appearances means the Switzerland international is probably Stoke s best hope of survival this season, What s more he s well on course to break a pretty impressive record this weekend with Terry Conroy being the last Stoke player to score four goals in succession in the top flight some years ago, Shaqiri will have his sights set on making it four out of four at Southampton on Saturday who join them in the Premier League s bottom five at the moment, Who else really, Kane simply can t stop scoring at the moment and duly tops Dream Team s points chart with Considering Mohamed Salah another excellent pick by the way is next up tells you all you need to know really, March could be a good month for Kane with Huddersfield this weekend Bournemouth Newcastle and Swansea upcoming as well as that Champions League clash against Juve, From obvious to not so obvious, Murray really has been one of the surprise packages in the Premier League this season constantly popping up with a goal or two in Brighton s excellent first season in the Premier League, Two against Swansea last weekend coupled with recent strikes against the likes of West Ham Southampton and Middlesbrough in the Cup shows us this guy has still got it and he s a bargain, Liverpool s undisputed No at the moment Karius has been in fine form between the sticks for the Reds lately, WHAT A TEAM goals with a clean sheet Incredible support by the fans who came all the way to Porto, Loris Karius LorisKarius, What s more the German has played in every league game since their win over Manchester City and has overseen clean sheets against Porto Southampton and Huddersfield in recent games, Will it be another against West Ham this weekend, It s been a fairly dire season for Arsenal we still can t quite believe how they played against Ostersunds but at least Monreal is seemingly enjoying himself, Following his first half opener in the Europa League last week Nacho has been involved in a pretty impressive five goals in his last six appearances in all competitions, Happy to get another goal and take home the result Same needed next week, Nacho Monreal nachomonreal, And if that s not enough that record is as many as he s managed in his previous games combined, Bit of a dark horse at the moment, After a terrific debut run out against Rochdale last weekend Moura will be facing a more regular level of opponent in the form of Crystal Palace on Sunday, Green screen day for, Tottenham Hotspur SpursOfficial, For those of you who snapped him up straight from the off nicely done The former PSG man picked up a decent haul of points in their FA Cup clash and will be keen for another good performance, Get im in while he s cheap we reckon, Outstanding during the week against Barcelona in the Champions League Willian will surely keep his place in the Chelsea line up as they take on United, Against Barca he rattled both posts and ran the Catalan giants ragged with his pace and technique refocusing the attention away from the likes of Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard, What s more priced at m he s cheaper than the likes of Jesse Lingard and Mesut Ozil at the moment, All has seemingly been forgiven between Mahrez and Leicester following the team s refusal to let him head out to Man City at the end of January, He spent a little bit of time sulking on the bench missing the games against Peterborough Everton and Swansea before eventually making an appearance against City and then starting against Sheffield United on Friday, Huge huge cheer from the fans as Mahrez s name is read out by the stadium announcer, Welcome home Riyad, James Sharpe TheSharpeEnd, Of course he duly set up Jamie Vardy for the only goal of the game and picked up the Star Man bonus in the process, Maybe it s time to stick this guy back in your Dream Team, What can we say about this guy, Five goals in seven appearances in all competitions goals in total makes the Brazilian the kind of centre forward Liverpool need no matter what former professionals say, Let s just forget any unpleasantness surrounding this guy huh, Because Aguero has been in red hot form for City this season netting a stunning goals in all competitions including two in the Carabao Cup so far, Reckon we re in for more final drama on Sunday, Manchester City ManCity, He ll be the main threat in a star studded line up at Wembley so much so that we almost feel a little sorry for the Gunners defence, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Stop laughing, Ospina was simply excellent in Arsenal s Europa League clash against Ostersunds during the week picking up a massive points thanks to his penalty save and all round adept performance, Did you know that David Ospina s penalty save last night was the first spot kick stop from an Arsenal goalkeeper since ukasz Fabia ski vs Bayern Munich in March, , ArsenalFanTV ArsenalFanTV, And it might be worth considering the Colombian for your Dream Team especially considering the Gunners No Petr Cech is close to be dropped following his recent bad run, It s been a rough couple of weeks for Man United who ve lost to Newcastle and Spurs since Alexis Sanchez joined from Arsenal, But one guy who can still keep his head held high despite not scoring in three matches is Lingard, , Jesse Lingard JesseLingard, The nippy winger hit his ninth goal of the season in United s last FA Cup match against Yeovil and will surely be given a run out against Huddersfield this weekend, What s more as the side s man in form he ll surely get a run out against Sevilla during the week too, Hazard was Chelsea s outstanding player against West Brom on Monday seemingly carrying them over the line against the Baggies, With his two goals he notched a very useful points and will surely play some role against Hull on Friday, I enjoyed both goals especially when we win, Hear from the man himself after last night s game, Chelsea FC ChelseaFC, However expect him to be the Blues undisputed starter against Barcelona during the week because if anyone in Chelsea s squad is going to perform against the Catalan giants it s him, Gross has undoubtedly been one of the standout performers for Brighton this season in their maiden Premier League campaign, The German leads the way on Dream Team points scored for the Seagulls with his performance in the win over West Ham a couple of weeks ago particularly memorable, He ll certainly be a popular pick for Brighton s home clash with Coventry on Saturday, While his form in the Premier League has been rather disappointing Iheanacho s run in the FA Cup has been spectacular with four goals in three appearances, He ll no doubt be a starter against Sheffield United on Friday and will be keen to continue the Foxes brilliant form in the competition, Another Chelsea star who enjoyed a good haul on Monday, Dave was the Blues defensive linchpin in the win over West Brom picking up eight points in the game and continuing to be one Dream Team s most reliable points scorers and popular picks, He ll need to be at his very best against Barca during the week though, Aguero picked up points in Gameweek, Need we say more, A very valuable three points coupled with brilliant team play And very happy for the goals Thanks to everyone for your full support C mon City, Sergio Kun Aguero aguerosergiokun, , , Fantasy football tips Game Week, Henrikh Mkhitaryan m, Only new Arsenal team mate Pierre Emerick Aubameyang was transferred in more than the Armenian before the last Game Week and he s been one of the most popular again this week, Three assists on his home debut for the Gunners outlined Mkhitaryan s worth when he gets in the right positions something he didn t do enough in his last months at Manchester United, Special home debut in front of the amazing fans Delighted with a hattrick of assists, Henrikh Mkhitaryan HenrikhMkh, But unlike Aubameyang Mkhitaryan IS available to play in the Europa League with Arsenal facing Swedish minnows Ostersunds next Thursday, That could be a potential gold mine for points, Callum Wilson m, Just because the Champions League is back doesn t mean you can neglect the rest of the Premier League hotshots, And Callum Wilson is our tip for this weekend, Callum Wilson has been directly involved in five goals in his last six appearances in the Premier League four goals and one assist Cherry, OptaJoe OptaJoe, The Bournemouth striker scored a hat trick in the win over Huddersfield earlier this season and he faces the Terriers again on Sunday, Emre Can m, Can has been a mainstay of the Liverpool side this season playing a whopping games in all competitions already, And considering he s just seven points short of his century on Dream Team he s been a shrewd pick, The Reds take on struggling Southampton on Sunday and then Porto next Wednesday in the Champions League a competition where he has enjoyed himself this season, Gerard Deulofeu m, He s back and he s ready to show Everton what they re missing, Deulofeu named man of the match against Chelsea, TalkFCB FCBNewsRoom, Deulofeu was superb for Watford against Chelsea on Monday scoring one and assisting another in the win at Vicarage Road, And he could be a hidden gem with games against West Ham Everton and West Brom on the horizon, Danilo m, Manchester City s unsung hero came to the fore last weekend with a beauty against Burnley, That earned him that precious Star Man award and points and with Benjamin Mendy and Fabian Delph out for a while he s likely to play a lot more, City still have four games in February starting with the visit of Leicester on Saturday evening, Dele Alli m, Harry Kane and Dele Alli in training ahead of the north London derby, Sun Bets SunBets, Alli is persona non grata at the moment after his latest diving scandal but he can let his football do the talking over the next week, He s the man for the big occasion and will fancy scoring again against Arsenal after his goal at White Hart Lane last season, And then it s Juventus in the Champions League a competition where he scored twice against Real Madrid on Tuesday, At m he s a whole lot cheaper than a lot of his midfield competitors including team mate, Paul Pogba m, Pogba has been missing in action somewhat recently and was even dropped by Jose Mourinho for the win over Huddersfield last weekend, But the Frenchman should be back against Newcastle and will be champing at the bit to impress his manager, The boss on It doesn t matter the tactical system the team plays for me Pogba is a midfield player He is a midfield player and that s it And it is difficult to find a midfield player with more potential than Paul because he has everything, Manchester United ManUtd, Manchester United face a Sevilla side in disarray at the moment so Pogba should really be back amongst the points, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Manchester City new boy Aymeric Laporte was thrown straight into the action on Wednesday starting for his new employers in their win over West Brom, The former Athletic Bilbao defender looked assured at the back scoring as WhoScored rating of and duly picking up a very satisfying eight points for Dream Team, Welcome to your new home, Manchester City ManCity, We re hoping to see him start on Saturday against Burnley although there s a chance John Stones could be in contention after recovering from an illness, Certainly one to watch, The Cherries are suddenly up to th in the table following wins over Chelsea and Arsenal recently, The early season relegation strugglers are playing well at the moment with Charlie Daniels Steve Cook and Ryan Fraser especially impressive, But the standout guy against the Blues was Nathan Ake who grabbed a goal and an assist against his former employers to earn the much deserved Star Man bonus that s a massive points from the last gameweek, Can he carry it through to this weekend against lowly Stoke, Manchester United looked bereft of ideas against Spurs during the week conceding a sloppy opener after just seconds and eventually losing at Wembley, They ll really want to do better against Huddersfield this weekend and they might just turn to Ander Herrera to spark their inspiration in the midfield, The Spaniard has been one of the best bargain buys on Dream Team this season and while he s rarely a consistent starter he s a big fan favourite and always gives his all for the team, We don t know about you but we think that s exactly what Jose Mourinho s team needs right now, It s been an awful few weeks for Chelsea whose season is threatening to collapse after their loss to Bournemouth during the week, And with their Carabao Cup knockout to Arsenal still fresh in the memory and the poor form of main goal getter Alvaro Morata the Blues will really want a strong result against Watford on Monday, Luckily they still have one man who s in great form in Eden Hazard who s the club s best player on Dream Team this season with points, He even managed eight points in Gameweek proving he s a great points scorer even when Chelsea are struggling, It s time for Arsenal s new boy to step up with the Gunners at a crucial stage of their season, They may have a Carabao Cup final to look forward to but costly defeats against Swansea and Bournemouth recently have severely dented their Champions League qualification hopes, Mkhitaryan played just over minutes against the Swans last week and will be hoping for a place in the starting line up against Everton on Saturday, Maybe he ll pick up an assist or two, My gosh he s expensive these days isn t he, Still with Harry Kane you get what you pay for, The Spurs front man is by far the best player you can sign on Dream Team this season averaging points a game with a tasty total of points, With goals to his name he s well on his way to winning another Golden Boot award, And against Liverpool this weekend he may just take full advantage of the Reds dodgy defence, Everton s new signing will be up against his former employers Arsenal this weekend and it s certainly a great time for him to play them, The year old who left the Emirates in early January after a year stay scored twice in the Toffees win over Leicester on Wednesday earning a very tasty points in the process, Will he come back to haunt the Gunners, Fantasy football tips Game Week, The late kick off on Sunday will see Premier League leaders Man City take on Championship promotion chasers Cardiff, Pep Guardiola s side are well on course to bring home four trophies this season having secured their place in the final of Carabao Cup earlier this week, And while Pep isn t the biggest fan of squad rotation we can certainly expect Danilo to make the starting line up, The full back started against Burnley in the third round win and what s more made just a brief appearance during the week against Bristol City so he ll be fresh and raring to go, Everyone s new favourite Liverpool defender was the hero of the night against Everton in their third round clash earlier this month, And he s sure to be the rock at the back against West Brom this weekend too, The Dutchman who s still a bargain on despite being the most picked player on the game this month is a renowned points scorer regularly picking up those all important Star Man bonuses, Get im in now while he s still affordable, From one bargain Liverpool defender to another, Robertson is all hype at the moment with his standout performance against Man City a couple of weeks ago still fresh in everyone s memory, He s more or less nailed down the left wing back position having been a regular starter in the side since Christmas, Another player you should seriously consider snapping up before his price soars, Sanchez finally sealed the move he wanted this week moving to Manchester United from Arsenal, And he s sure to make his United debut against Yeovil on Friday evening, Jose Mourinho said he s likely to play a very strong team against the League Two minnows and the cup clash will be the perfect opportunity for Sanchez to hit the ground running, He s pretty expensive on Dream Team despite not reaching the lofty heights he did last season, But now that he s out of the frustrating atmosphere of the Emirates we re hoping to see him bring home the points, Following Chelsea s Carabao Cup semi final defeat to Arsenal manager Antonio Conte was publicly critical of Barkley, Not the best start to life at Stamford Bridge for the midfielder then eh, But against Newcastle this weekend he has the perfect chance to impress, And with the likes of Willian and Cesc Fabregas likely to miss the tie Barkley is fully expected to make his home debut, With the arrival of Sanchez at Old Trafford this guy really needs to do his best to impress, Rashford began the season as United s first choice left winger but has since lost his place in the starting line up to Anthony Martial, And with Sanchez joining from Arsenal the year old is likely to drop further down the pecking order, A good run out against Yeovil where he s sure to make some kind of appearance could make or break his season, Batshuayi is Chelsea s go to guy up front at the moment with Alvaro Morata out with an injury, And while he might not be with the Blues much longer he s still Conte s sole choice up front against Newcastle, He might be worth a gamble too having grabbed the opener against Norwich in the third round replay and notching an assist in the game against Brighton, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Chelsea will probably play a strong line up against Leicester on Saturday and rest their big stars against Norwich in the FA Cup on Wednesday so we expect Alonso to start at the weekend at least, And what s more the wing back is in great form at the moment having scored in three of his last five league games, He s currently the second best defender to pick on Dream Team while only Alvaro Morata and Eden Hazard have scored more than him in the Chelsea squad this season, Liverpool s new centre back has been by far the most transferred in player on Dream Team over the last two Gameweeks, And with good reason, Not only has he been a fantasy football favourite over the last couple of years but his goalscoring debut against Everton last time has showed us all he s really hit the ground running at his new club, His next big test will be against Manchester City on Sunday, Speaking of which, Sterling has been in blinding form this season for City as they look to run away with the title, The England winger has notched goals in the league so far including five in his last five Prem appearances, What s more with Gabriel Jesus currently out with an injury expect Pep Guardiola to put further goal scoring responsibly on his capable shoulders, This guy can t stop scoring at the moment, He notched twice in Man United s win over Arsenal at the start of December and since then he s hit five more including a screamer against Derby last time out, What s more he s picked up an incredible points on Dream Team in his last four appearances, On current form he could have a field day against Stoke on Monday, With a number of his teammates on the sidelines at the moment including Jason Puncheon and Andros Townsend there will be extra pressure on Zaha to produce the goods for Palace against Burnley this weekend, Luckily the winger has been one of the Eagles standout stars this season with his recent performances against Arsenal and City particularly eye catching, Tottenham s ever reliable goalscorer has netted in each of his last four home games including belter against West Ham last time out, He ll be up against a rejuvenated Everton side on Saturday evening so we can definitely see Mauricio Pochettino calling upon his services even if it s only from the bench, With Jesus currently out of action Aguero is once again City s main man in attack with a little help from Sterling, And with four goals in his last three appearances the club s record scorer has proven he s still the man Guardiola can turn to, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Sergio Aguero, Aguero should be your main man for the coming weeks after Gabriel Jesus was crocked with a long term injury, The Argentine has had to share the goalscoring duty with Jesus in the last months but his team mate s knock opens the door to a more prolonged spell in the side, Manchester City play six times this month starting with Burnley and Bristol City over the next five days or so, Theo Walcott, Arsenal s man for the smaller occasion is likely to get a rare run out against Nottingham Forest on Sunday but it remains to be seen how Arsene Wenger will treat their League Cup semi final with Chelsea, Walcott has had his opportunities limited after the arrival of Alexandre Lacazette in the summer so he needs to grasp his chance in the FA Cup with both hands, It might well be his last appearance for the Gunners with a move back to Southampton in January mooted, Bernardo Silva, Arguably the most talented back up option in the Premier League the form of Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane has seen Silva s chances limited since his summer move from Monaco, But when called upon he s delivered and that should happen again in the coming days, Silva is likely to start at least one if not both of City s two cup games over the next week with Pep Guardiola s unprecedented quadruple hopes still alive, Adrien Silva, Continuing with the Silva theme Leicester s m new boy should make his first start this weekend against Fleetwood in the FA Cup, The Portuguese international has had to patiently wait for his debut after missing the summer transfer deadline by a matter of seconds, But he s ready and raring to go and with an eye for a goal he could be a favourite, Willian, Antonio Conte will almost certainly rotate his Chelsea side for their trip to Norwich on Saturday evening which means Willian should play, The Brazilian was unlucky not to start against Arsenal in midweek considering his recent performances with three goals and four assists in his last seven games, But the Canaries and then the Gunners again on Tuesday could be the perfect occasion for him to carry on his purple patch, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Crystal Palace s rise from the depths of the Premier League table to th place has been pretty spectacular and Dann has been a big part of that in recent games, The defender has carried home points on Dream Team in his last three games which includes a goal in the draw against Bournemouth and a cleansheet in the brilliant win over Leicester last time out, Up against managerless Swansea at the weekend Dann and co will be eager to continue their miraculous climb from almost certain relegation a few weeks ago, Still one of Chelsea s main players despite the likes of Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger knocking on the door, The Blues take on Everton and Brighton in their next two games and with the Toffees recent improvement thanks largely to a certain Wayne Rooney up front more on him later they ll be keen to have their experienced centre back front and centre in their back line, points on Dream Team so far this season is far lower than what we d expect from the Chelsea captain but he s still worth your consideration especially with their Carabao Cup clash against Arsenal coming up, It s rare to see such a gifted midfielder playing for the runaway Premier League leaders no less so affordable on Dream Team, But there we go, And not only is he cheap but Gundogan has been exceptional in recent games, He s notched points in his last two appearances for the Citizens which included a goal against Spurs and the Star Man bonus against Leicester, He s clearly finding his form at the centre of Guardiola s well oiled machine and will fancy his chances in upcoming games against Bournemouth and Newcastle, It s all suddenly starting to look very good for David Moyes at West Ham with the Hammers clear of the relegation zone after a run of good form, One man who mirrors the club s turnaround in form is Arnautovic who s scored two goals in his last three Premier League outings picking up Dream Team points in the process Well worth the m we reckon especially with fairly winnable games against Newcastle and Bournemouth coming up, One guy we can t get enough off right now, Manchester City s top goalscorer in the Premier League with that s right more than Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus has been sensational this season and one of their main cogs in their incredible point lead at the top of the table, He s currently third in Dream Team s overall points tally just trailing Mohamed Salah and Harry Kane, If you haven t picked him up yet then you really should, It s time to stick Zlatan in your Dream Team, The enigmatic Swede is back having surprised everyone by recovering from his serious knee ligament before the new year and has already made his first start of the season in Manchester United s Carabao Cup defeat to Bristol, He scored in that game too and with Romelu Lukaku continuing to struggle to find the back of the net he could once again be key to United s success this season, It s true folks Rooney can still bang em in, He s reached double figures for Everton already having netted in their last three games to go along with his excellent hat trick against West Ham a few weeks ago, Proof that the Roon is still worth a place in your fantasy football team especially he s already up to points for the season, , Fantasy football tips Game Week, What can you say about Silva, The Manchester City technician is simply a magician and has seemingly upped his levels of mastery in recent weeks, Silva has scored three times in his last two games and will fancy adding to that tally against Tottenham on Saturday evening, West Ham suddenly look an organised outfit again under David Moyes and his decision to drop Joe Hart for Adrian has been vindicated, The Spaniard kept back to back clean sheets against Chelsea and Arsenal and collected a whopping points in Game Week, Feeling after min of hard work getting massive points phenomenal clean sheet in a London derbi at home Thanks all fans for your amazing support, Adri n San Miguel AdriSanMiguel, The Hammers travel to Stoke this weekend and with Adrian in between the sticks are looking far more sturdy, The top goalscoring defender in the Premier League and an absolute points scoring machine, Only Harry Kane and Mohamed Salah sit above Otamendi in the Dream Team player rankings after Otamendi registed in total last week, The Argentine is expensive but if he keeps scoring as well as his clean sheets he s an absolute must have, Tarkowski and Burnley continue to defy all logic this season in actually mounting a challenge for a top four spot, The Clarets are level on points with Tottenham and Liverpool and one above Arsenal with their resolute defence the shining light for Sean Dyche, Tarkowski is the highest scoring player outside the Premier League s top six clubs and with the European football out of the equation for a while he could be a real asset, Mahrez is beginning to show the kind of form that won him the PFA Player of the Year award back in, The Algerian is back to his brilliant best under Claude Puel scoring in three of his last four as Leicester surge up the table, Claude Puel returning to St Mary s and being up at half time like, Dream Team dreamteamfc, Mahrez and co face Crystal Palace on Saturday and will be looking to add to the four goals they smashed past Southampton in midweek, All of a sudden Everton look like a team again after Sam Allardyce s arrival, Big Sam has done exactly what the doctor ordered tightening the Toffees up at the back and getting the best out of Wayne Rooney, The former England captain scored two vital goals in Game Week to earn them four points and could very well continue his red hot form against Swansea on Monday, In Son Spurs have a go to man if Harry Kane isn t at the races, The South Korean has cemented himself as one of the first names on the teamsheet in the last couple of months outperforming the likes of Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen, Son scored the equaliser when Spurs met Manchester City last season and he will fancy adding to his eight goals this season at the Etihad again on Saturday, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Crystal Palace haven t had much to shout about this season but they re currently enjoying a four match unbeaten run that s seen them climb to th in the Premier League table, Back to back goalless draws have mirrored Roy Hodgson s famously well organised approach to management with Sakho the linchpin of his side s defensive display, , Mamadou Sakho mamadousakho, The former Liverpool defender has been outstanding in recent games picking up an impressive eight points in each of his last three outings, He ll certainly fancy picking up a third consecutive cleansheet this weekend against Bournemouth so he might be worth a place in your Dream Team, Pep Guardiola has confirmed Manchester City s midfield maestro will be fit for the weekend s Manchester derby which is fantastic news for City fans, The Spaniard who s largely considered to be City s greatest ever player has been as influential as ever this season notching eight assists and two goals in games so far and scoring points on Dream Team, With United s Paul Pogba set to miss the next three Premier League games including the derby through suspension, We re not going to recommend City stars ahead of this weekend s Manchester derby, Lingard has all of the ability to influence the mammoth clash in the favour of the Reds especially in current form, The Manchester lad has scored three goals in his last two Premier League games picking up a staggering Dream Team points in the process, We ll never forget this goal, Jesse Lingard JesseLingard, What s more he loves a big game having famous scored in the FA Cup final EFL Cup final and Community Shield, He s also grabbed goals against Arsenal and Chelsea in the past and we re sure he d love to get one against City, What can we say about this guy, He costs a pretty penny on Dream Team at the moment but with good reasons, He s been simply awesome for Chelsea recently and has been the apple of our Fantasy Football eye in the process, His two goals against Newcastle last weekend gave you points while he was inspirational in the midweek duel with Atletico Madrid, He could have a field day against West Ham s back line at the weekend, From awesome to fantastic Coutinho is in the form of his life at the moment, Fresh from his midweek Champions League heroics in which Liverpool s playmaker notched an impressive hat trick the Brazilian is now ranked fourth in Dream Team s overall points standings, He s still some way off teammate Mohamed Salah mind but having been handed the captains armband during the week Jurgen Klopp clearly believes his No can add leadership and experience to his game, Two attributes that could certainly set him apart as the Reds take on their bitter Merseyside rivals Everton, It may seem as if Walcott has been relatively quiet for Arsenal so far this season but the speedy forward still boasts points on Dream Team, In typical Arsenal style the England international has been out of action for a good few weeks recently but made a goalscoring return to the starting XI in the Gunners Europa League clash against BATE on Thursday, Happy to be back on the pitch with a great team effort back on the scoresheet, Theo Walcott theowalcott, Whether he starts against his former employers Southampton on Sunday is another matter but we can certainly see him making a contribution, While he s rarely seen much of Everton s first team this season Lookman is surely a star of the future, And he hit the headlines this week by netting a double in the Toffees final Europa League group game in Cyrpus against Apollon Limassol, Very Good win Happy with the brace, Ademola Lookman Alookman, Lookman was a big part of the England U side that won the World Cup back in May and could give Everton a new lease of life upfront, The year old scored of his season total points against Apollon securing that crucial Dream Team Star Man award in the process, While Big Sam s Toffees face a daunting prospect of taking on an in form Liverpool this weekend the following fixtures look brighter with games against struggling Newcastle and Swansea, So will the pacy attacker get more game time under this season, , , Fantasy football tips Game Week, Comes with quite a hefty price tag but crucial last minute winners on a weekly basis do not come cheap, Sterling has become integral to Pep s side at the Etihad and seems to have grown into a dominant Premier League force and match winner, City face West Ham who conceded four against strikerless Everton in mid week and the Citizens should put them to the sword, The market is favouring Sterling to have a hand in a big win with nearly of you transferring him in, Wayne Rooney scored his first Everton hat trick against West Ham and what a trio of goals it was, The former England captain rounded it off with a sumptuous driven strike from his own half, Dream Team managers are showing Rooney some love ranking him as one of the most transferred in players this week, Can he reproduce the point haul against Huddersfield this weekend, When Marc Albrighton fires so do Leicester, That was certainly the case when they sank Spurs on Wednesday with two excellent goals, The unfashionable midfielder delivered an inch perfect cross for the first goal and had the better of Serge Aurier all evening, Albrighton is selected by just of managers but last week he garnered points get him in for the home tie against Burnley for just million, Ashley Young is back but was he ever away, Yes definitely, The Man United man scored nearly half of his total Dream Team points with a brace against Watford on Tuesday, Another steal at m you can get ahead of of fantasy managers if you bring him for the Red Devils trip to the Emirates, After his run in with Pep Guardiola on the Etihad touchline Nathan Redmond might have a spring in his step, Southampton have a nice south coast derby against hapless Bournemouth and with Pep s words of encouragement ringing in his ears we are backing Redmond to hit form, Southampton haven t been in great form of late but Bournemouth have been a lot worse the Saints will be looking to Redmond to lead the procession here, The super sub could finally get his moment on the big stage, Alexandre Lacazette picked up an injury against Huddersfield and Giroud scored twice leaving Arsene Wenger no choice but to let him lead the line against United, Mesut Ozil appears to be hitting his straps and the German could give Giroud goals on a plate on Saturday s late kick off, This is the time to pick Eden, Newcastle are coming to Stamford Bridge and Chelsea have won four of their last five and Hazard is at the heart of everything good right now, At a cost of m the Belgian is expensive but you can expect goals and assists, Hazard has already scored points the season and only around a tenth of managers have selected him get ahead of the crowd now, Fantasy football tips Game Week, We know we know, This guy hasn t been the most popular Premier League shot stopper over the years, The Brazilian has a somewhat dodgy reputation stretching back to his Tottenham days with a string of high profile errors and misjudgements eventually leading to Spurs ditching him for year old Brad Friedel back in, Three incredible saves s was in superb form once again last weekend, Watford Football Club WatfordFC, But he s been in top form for Watford this season aiding the Hornet s miraculous rise up the table with several decent displays, Notably his phenomenal double save in the dying moments of their game against West Ham last weekend was the talk of Gameweek, He well and truly earned his eight Dream Team points and he ll be keen to continue his good form against Newcastle on Saturday, Walkers move from Spurs to Manchester City over the summer has turned out to be a resounding success story for all parties, While he s hardly missed at White Hart Lane thanks to the emergence of Kieran Trippier and Serge Aurier his place in Pep Guardiola s side is without question following a string of stand out performances this season, Another three points and clean sheet We re staying focused and continuing to work hard, Kyle Walker kylewalker, Boasting a rating in the Premier League on and with four assists to his name he s continued to establish himself as one of the best full backs around, What s more he s lapping up those cleansheet bonuses on Dream Team this season with in all competitions so far, Reckon it ll be against Huddersfield on Sunday, We do, Arsenal are back folks, The Gunners reasserted their claim as top dog in North London last weekend after a dominant win over Spurs thanks to goals from Shkodran Mustafi and Alexis Sanchez, But it was Ozil who really shone for Arsene Wenger s side claiming the man of the match gong for his inspirational work in midfield, , Mesut zil MesutOzil, Often criticised for his inconsistent performances Ozil showed drive and determination against the club s bitter foes, Maybe this is the start of something special from the German playmaker, At the very least he remains far cheaper than many of his contemporaries including Philippe Coutinho m and Christan Eriksen m, Cork has often gone under the radar for his performances at Southampton Swansea and now Burnley so we were delighted when he won his first England cap earlier this month, And to celebrate he notched the opener in Burnley s win over Swansea last time out picking up a further eight points for his season haul, He might not be a regular points man but priced at just m on Dream Team at the moment he s surely well worth your small change, If you haven t got this guy in your Dream Team then you re doing fantasy football all wrong, Salah has been one of the stars of the season so far having hit nine goals in the Premier League for Liverpool more than anyone else, Not bad for a Chelsea reject eh, The Egyptian winger is up against his old employers this weekend and will be itching to show them how wrong they were to flog him two years ago, It was certainly nice to see this fella score a hat trick against Huddersfield last weekend his first goals of the season and his first treble since his back to back cruciate ligament injuries in both knees, And now that he s seemingly back to full fitness and still capable of notching a goal or three he might well be worth a gamble considering how low his price is right now, Don t hang around for too long because that price could sky rocket, If like us you took Lukaku out of your Dream Team long ago then it might be time you put him back in, The Belgian struck Man United s fourth goal in their mauling of Newcastle last week his first for United since the end of September, And just in the nick of time too with Zlatan Ibrahimovic making his return to the side from his lengthy injury spell Lukaku might just start remembering how to bang them in with the added competition for places in attack, Fantasy football tips Game Week, This guy is shaping up to be our favourite goalkeeper in the Premier League this season after a string of impressive displays between the sticks at Burnley, Pope has had a lot to deal with since replacing the stricken Tom Heaton having been thrown in at the deep end against the likes of Liverpool Everton and Manchester City, But his form for the Clarets has been spectacular and he was even nominated for the Premier League Player of the Month award for October while his five clean sheets in eight league outings has lead many to claim he deserves an England call up, In the meantime we implore you stick him into your ahead of Burnley s clash against lowly Swansea this weekend, This guy s a real mover this week with nearly managers picking him for their fantasy team, And with good reason, His performances for England against Germany and Brazil as a centre back were outstanding last week, But having mainly been used as a right back for the Reds this term will Jurgen Klopp be tempted to start him in the centre against Southampton s fairly weak attack this weekend, Only of managers have this Chelsea defender in their team at the moment, But after his performance against Manchester United last time out and his heroics against the Republic of Ireland for Denmark during the week we reckon a good few more will pick him ahead of Gameweek, After a decent spell on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach last season and the season before the year old is more than ready to challenge for a regular starting role with the Blues especially with David Luiz considerably out of favour with Antonio Conte at the moment, He s been one of the most exciting players in the Premier League this season and a big part of Manchester City s charge to the top of the table, And he was pretty decent against England last week too rattling Jordan Pickford s crossbar from distance in one of the best moments of the game, Up against Leicester this weekend we can definitely see him getting the better of Danny Simpson on the flank as Pep Guardiola s side look to continue their sensational form, Fresh from breaking Irish hearts for the Danes this week Eriksen will be keen to keep his goalscoring boots on in the North London derby this weekend, He s never scored against Arsenal for Spurs but there s no time like the present eh, The playmaker has been ever present for Mauricio Pochettino s side this season and he s currently totalling points on making him one of the best midfielders on the game, You really need him in your side, With two more England caps under his belt and a regular place in Manchester United s starting XI this season things are certainly looking up for young Rashford, And what s more with Romelu Lukaku lacking in front of goal at the moment the year old is slowly shaping up to be Jose Mourinho s main attacking outlet at the moment along with Anthony Martial, After United s defeat to Chelsea last time out the Red Devils will be looking to snatch back their early season momentum so can they get a result against old foes Newcastle this weekend, We sure do love this fella here at DTHQ and why not, He s adjusted to life in the Premier League effortlessly this season scoring four times in the Premier League for Watford and being a big part of their position in the top at the moment, He s also been a revelation for manager s this season notching points on the game so far, We fancy him to pick up some serious points against West Ham this weekend, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Jamaal Lascelles, It s fair to say that Newcastle like their fellow promotees Huddersfield and Brighton have enjoyed a decent start to life back in the top flight, The Magpies head into the weekend in the top of the Premier League table despite their defeat to Burnley on Monday, And one player who s arguably stood out the most for Rafa Benitez s side is captain Lascelles who s already shaping up to be a Dream Team favourite having already amassed points this season, Struggling Bournemouth visit St James Park this weekend and at just m it might be time you snapped up this in form defender while he s still so affordable, Kurt Zouma, Speaking of Dream Team favourites, Zouma s loan move to Stoke is shaping up to be a pretty good piece of summer business by Mark Hughes with the Frenchman quickly establishing himself as one of club s most important players this season, With a rating of coupled with the points he s amassed on Dream Team the youngster looks like an absolute steal on the game priced at just m, We implore you to get him ahead of Stoke s game against Leicester this weekend, Robbie Brady, Quite possibly the best bargain buy on Dream Team this season is Burnley s Brady, With points the bargain midfielder priced at m is rubbing shoulders with the very best on fantasy football and is clearly a big part of the Clarets incredible run, Sean Dyche s side who are currently in the top seven of the Premier League face Southampton this weekend and will clearly want to continue their push up the table, Raheem Sterling, Man City are an absolute joy to watch this season, Not only that but the table toppers have been a rich source of fantasy football mainstays this season with Kevin De Bruyne Gabriel Jesus and Kyle Walker among Dream Team s most picked players so far this term, Another popular pick on the game is Sterling who s transformation under Pep Guardiola has been simply sensational, The winger has scored seven times in the Premier League so far this campaign putting him joint second behind Harry Kane, Will he add to his tally against Arsenal this weekend, Dele Alli, Another young Englishman who s looking very good ahead of this summer s World Cup is Alli, The midfielder was chief tormentor in Spurs Champions League win over Real Madrid during the week and will be keen to carry that fantastic form against bottom of the pack Crystal Palace on Sunday, Sergio Aguero, He s back guys and guess what He s now Man City s all time goalscorer, It was only a matter of time before the Argentinian surpassed Eric Brook s record after netting againsy Napoli in the Champions League midweek, So we imagine he s full of confidence going into Gameweek, Get im in folks You won t regret it, Tammy Abraham, Swansea s go to guy upfront this season looks all set to make his first appearance for England next week having been called up to Gareth Southgate s squad for the first time, The youngster has hit four goals in the Premier League for the struggling Swans so far this term and we expect his confidence to be through the roof ahead of their home clash against Brighton this weekend, Now looks like a very good time to include the youngster in your Dream Team, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Riyad Mahrez, Is the Algerian maestro back to his best, Two virtuoso displays this week starting with two assists at Swansea last weekend and a goal in the League Cup in midweek gave Mahrez points and saw him finish level with Harry Kane as the Game Week s top scorer, Mahrez and Leicester welcome struggling Everton to the King Power Stadium this weekend and at just m is at a bargain price right now, Harry Kane, Time to gamble, in a devastating blow to Mauricio Pochettino s hopes of a first ever win at Old Trafford, The Spurs maestro has been in electric form but the extent of his hamstring injury is unknown so do you transfer him out or have faith in a speedy recovery, Callum Wilson, A forgotten man after his injury nightmares but Wilson showed his value to Bournemouth this week with a goal and an assist in the League Cup on his return to the first team, The England striker is working his way back to full fitness and could be vital for the Cherries in their bid to avoid relegation, At m he s a snip for your Dream Team too, Nicolas Otamendi, There s nothing more valuable than a Dream Team joker in the pack and Otamendi really is that, The Argentine is a huge WhoScored algorithm favourite even if he might not always instil confidence at the back, Otamendi is a points scoring machine with a whopping so far this season and City travel to West Brom on Saturday with another clean sheet in the offing, Mesut Ozil, Ozil was devastating at Everton last week after a number of niggling injury problems this season, The German is back to assume the role of Arsenal s creative hub again in tandem with Alexis Sanchez and Alexandre Lacazette and Swansea are there for the taking on Saturday, At a bargain m Ozil really should be worth your consideration if he can stay fit, Abdoulaye Doucoure, Watford have been the surprise package so far this campaign and Doucoure has been the pick of the bunch at Vicarage Road, The box to box midfielder has four goals already with his latest coming in the defeat at Chelsea last Saturday, Only of managers have him in their Dream Teams this season and their seeing the rewards, Andre Ayew, West Ham and strikers haven t exactly been a match made in recent seasons with the likes of Diafra Sakho and Andy Carroll struggling to find any kind of regular form, So Ayew s double in the Hammers dramatic League Cup win over Spurs in midweek might be just the platform he needs to nail down a regular starting role, The Irons travel to basement side Crystal Palace needing a good performance to preserve Slaven Bilic s job for another week, Fantasy football tips Game Week, Michy Batshuayi, Time to step up Michy, Alvaro Morata s hamstring injury could give the cheeky Belgian a chance to shine when Chelsea travel to Crystal Palace this weekend, Batshuayi has six goals in his last six games for club and country and could put the hapless Eagles to the sword at Selhurst Park if Antonio Conte plays him from the start, Harry Kane, How do you inhibit an immovable force, Kane won Premier League player of the month for September pretty emphatically after smashing goals altogether, Tottenham welcome lowly Bournemouth to Wembley on Saturday and with Kane in the best form of his life should banish any hint of a hoodoo at their temporary home, Philippe Coutinho, After a highly convenient back strain kept him out of the side while the Barcelona transfer saga rumbled on Coutinho s return to the Liverpool first team has been sensational, Three goals in as many games two of them typically spectacular has seen the Brazilian restored as the Reds main man again, They host arch rivals United on Saturday without Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini which might just give Coutinho more room to work his magic, Nick Pope, This time last month Pope was a relative unknown but four weeks after a man of the match display at Anfield he s emerged as one of the finds of the season, The stand in goalkeeper has handled the unenviable task of replicating Tom Heaton s heroics brilliantly racking up points from just six games played for Burnley, This weekend the Clarets welcome West Ham to Turf Moor with another clean sheet likely, Pascal Gross, Brighton have had a tough start to the season but in Gross they have a player capable of making sure their stay in the Premier League isn t a short lived one, The Seagulls play struggling Everton on Sunday who look tactically clueless and low on confidence, Gross is Brighton s top points scorer this season with and he could thrive again at the Amex Stadium on Sunday lunchtime, Richarlison, Dream Team s best performing Brazilian above the likes of Gabriel Jesus Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino has taken to life in England brilliantly, Richarlison has three goals already and will fancy his chances against an Arsenal side who have picked up only one point away from home this season, The year old is a midfielder on the game but regularly finds himself in advanced positions which is a real fantasy football hack, Tammy Abraham, Swansea host Huddersfield in a must win game for the Welsh side to really get their season going, Paul Clement needs goals with his side managing just three in the league so far and Abraham is likely to be the man to rely on, The former Chelsea has bagged two of those three goals and will surely get the chance to add to that tally against the Terriers, Will Butland be England s No at the World Cup this summer, Considering Joe Hart s less than impressive recent form, The young shot stopper has been one of the Potters standout performers this season and was key for them in recent games against Arsenal and Manchester United, He s also proving to an affordable option on priced below the likes of Kasper Schmeichel and Lukasz Fabianski, Up against a Southampton side this weekend who have struggled to score we re predicting a good Gameweek for the year old, Valencia has continued to excel in the right back position for Man United this season, Combining his defensive nous with his instinctive attacking mentality Valencia has been a great source of points with his ability to score assist and keep a clean sheet, With United playing hapless Crystal Palace this weekend we fully expect the Ecuadorian to score big for the managers who pick him, You ve got to feel a little sorry for Danny Rose, Tottenham s first choice left back is looking less likely to walk back into the starting line up with every passing week thanks to the sheer brilliance of Davies this season, The Wales international has proven to be a great pick for managers scoring once setting up two goals keeping three clean sheets and racking up points since the opening day of the season, With Rose still set to be out for a while we implore you get Davies in ASAP before his price rockets, With all of those summer rumours behind us it s time to stick Coutinho back into your, The Brazilian has been gently eased back into Liverpool s starting line up by Jurgen Klopp following his back injury and played minutes against Spartak Moscow during the week, The Reds visit Newcastle this weekend and we see no reason why Coutinho wouldn t be in contention, We love a gamble here at, And what bigger gamble is there than sticking Wilshere into your fantasy football team, The seldom seen midfielder put in a, Perhaps not the most convincing of opponents but the England playmaker has done himself plenty of favours especially considering the question marks over Mesut Ozil s fitness, He s really freakin cheap too, Anthony Martial has seemingly made the left wing role his own at Man United in recent weeks, But after picking up a knock on Wednesday night it looks like Rashford is a certain starter, And we re sure the teenager will fully embrace the opportunity as United s terrifying attack faces down and out Palace for Gameweek, We predict big points all round for United s forwards, it s time to transfer out the Man City forward and maybe use that large chunk of budget on Kane instead, The Spurs hitman is a whopping m pricier than Aguero but is well worth the money considering his recent form, Five goals in the last week alone two in the Prem three in the Champions League means Kane is way out in front of s points tally with, What s the betting he ll add to that tally when Spurs travel to Huddersfield this weekend, That s the beauty of there s no budget limitations so you can pick both goal machines when Chelsea take on Man City in the biggest game of the season so far on Saturday, That means you don t have to worry about sacrificing different parts of your side to include two of the finest strikers the Premier League has to offer, Weekender is the best new fantasy football game around and it s to enter, Just select seven players from across the Saturday and Sunday Premier League fixtures for your chance to bag that this weekend, Flopped last week It doesn t matter as Weekender allows you to start afresh every single weekend Let the games begin, It s never wise to splash out on pricey goalkeepers for your so picking a regular points scorer between the sticks who break the bank tends to separate the winners from the also rans, And right now we can t think of anyone who fits the bill better than Fabianski, The Polish shot stopper was given a much needed rest for Swansea s midweek Carabao Cup clash against Reading having played in all of the Swans Premier League games so far this season, But even so he remains just behind David De Gea on this season s total points tally for goalkeepers with a rather nice, He was given the star man award in their last league outing against Tottenham keeping his third clean sheet of the season in the process, Up against a possibly rattled Watford this weekend with games against West Ham and Huddersfield to follow the former Arsenal man could well be the man of the moment, Everton players especially defenders have been haemorrhaging points for managers so far this season with the club s last four games resulting in pretty heavy defeats bringing about an aggregate score of, Now is certainly not a good time to be a fan of the Toffees, However their next few fixtures look favourable and should allow the club to pick up some much needed points, Having defeated Sunderland in their mid week Carabao Cup game their next three fixtures are all at home starting with Saturday s game against Bournemouth which is followed by Apollon in the Europa League and Burnley next weekend, What s more back to back defeats mean Everton players are cheaper than ever at the moment, Get em in while it lasts we say, We sure can t get enough of this guy at the moment, The Bosnian tank has fast become an Arsenal fan favourite since his arrival from Schalke this summer and with good reason, The defender has already displayed his influence on the side scoring important goals against Koln last week along with his strike in the season opening Community Shield, He ll face an entirely new challenge against West Brom this weekend but will be buoyed by clean sheets in the Gunners previous two games including last time out against Chelsea, Star man award this weekend, We ve got an inkling, Admittedly some of our Sanches related hype has receded ever so slightly since he made the shock move to Swansea on transfer deadline day, He s picked up just eight points on in the three games he s played for the Swans this season with the youngster just beginning to display glimpses of his European Golden Boy winning talent, In the mid week win over Reading he appeared far more confident on the ball and began to dictate the play with far more assurance, Like we mentioned above Swansea s next few games are favourable and could help the Portuguese youngster s development with the side, And if you re strapped for cash and willing to make a gamble in midfield then Sanches is definitely your guy, Brady has amassed an impressive points on the game more than the likes of Henrikh Mkhitaryan Marcos Alonso and David Silva to name a few, But only of managers are picking him on the game at the moment, If you want to get him in for Gameweek then Burnley face newly promoted Huddersfield at the seemingly impenetrable Turf Moor, He s the fantasy football gem who keeps on giving, Leicester s main man remains one of Dream Team s most consistent points scorers currently hovering below the big guns with points to his name, But he s by far one of the game s best options below m far out weighing the points hauls of Alexandre Lacazette m and Son Heung min m, He s also facing a Liverpool side this weekend who are leaking goals left right and centre at the moment, If there s anyone likely to exploit the predicted pairing of Ragnar Klavan and Joel Gomez it s this guy, There s no one pricier on the game right now but with Aguero you really get your money s worth, A hat trick last time out against Watford means his Premier League tally is level with Romelu Lukaku s five goals while the pair are also virtually neck and neck for Dream Team points, With Man City up against hapless Crystal Palace this weekend we sure do like the odds of this man adding to his tally, For those of you who followed our advice last time and stuck Tom Heaton into your side we sincerely apologise, The Burnley keeper lasted just minutes against Crystal Palace last week before dislocating his shoulder, Ouch, So if you have Heaton in your Dream Team transfer him out ASAP and maybe consider replacing him with Newcastle s Rob Elliot, The cheap but reliable Magpies stopper has kept clean sheets in his last two Premier League appearances for the side and will relish the chance to make it three in a row against Stoke this weekend, This guy is shaping up to be more than just a dodgy facial expression raking in an impressive points on Dream Team so far this season, What s more the Manchester United centre back has played minutes in every game so far this season apart from United s Champions League clash against Basel during the week because he was suspended, So well rested and up against a Everton side who have struggled for goals in recent games we think you could do a lot worse than Jonesy at the back for Gameweek, From Jones to Stones here s another English defender who s often ridiculed, But TWO goals for Man City against Feyenoord during the week gave managers who picked him a lovely point haul, And while we doubt we ll see the former Everton man grab another brace this weekend he ll certainly be hoping to keep another cleansheet when his side face Watford, If you haven t got this midfield genius in your fantasy football team then what are you playing at, Eriksen has amassed points on Dream Team so far this season and unlike fellow midfield heavy weights like Dele Alli and Sadio Mane is a pretty consistent points scorer, But get him in quick as we fully expect him to run the show against Swansea this weekend, What s more Spurs upcoming fixtures are extremely favourable and his price is only going to rise, Good news everybody, Choupo Moting is finally available on Dream Team and just in time for the weekend, The Cameroonian was delightfully devastating in Stoke s draw against Man United last time out scoring twice against the previously impenetrable Daid De Gea, The No has been at the forefront of virtually everything good Stoke has done so far this season and is well worth your small change if your Dream Team requires an explosive attacking presence in midfield, The scars of England s Euro exit to Iceland still haven t quite healed but we re reasonable folk and we re willing to give Roy Hodgson a chance, But the new Palace manager is certainly up against it in his new job with games against Man City Man Untied and Chelsea coming up, For now his focus will be on the Eagles first game under his leadership at home to Southampton for Saturday s lunchtime kick off, It s a fairly favourable first game for ol Roy who will be hoping to get the best out of striker Christain Benteke in his side s attack, The towering Belgian is not exactly the sort of guy who sets pulses racing but he s almost exactly the sort of forward the former Liverpool and West Brom coach favours, Here s a guy who s really enjoying life in the Premier League, After a season on the peripherals at Real Madrid Morata is Chelsea s main man and is lovin it, Three goals for the Blues so far this season tells you all you need to know and we think he s just getting started, Up against Arsenal s dodgy defence this weekend we can definitely see the Spanish striker grabbing a goal or two, The Gunners have really struggled against burly centre forwards this season, You know what to do, Danny Higginbotham s best bets, We simply Heaton here at DTHQ, The Burnley keeper was one of our favourite players on Dream Team last season amassing saves the most of anyone in the top flight and keeping clean sheets in the process, His fairly slow start to the new season has seen him slightly drop in price but with the Clarets taking on Crystal Palace at home this weekend now seems like a great time to get the reliable shot stopper into your team, Why, Well you don t need me to tell you that Palace look bereft of ideas at the minute while Turf Moor continues to be something of a fortress for Sean Dyche s men, Swansea will be keen to build on their win over Palace just before the international break and face struggling Newcastle this weekend, And hoping to keeping things tidy at the back for the Swans is the hard tackling defender Mawson, The young centre back was one of the breakout stars of last season and will want to give Gareth Southgate something to think about for the next run of England games In the meantime we reckon he s worth your small change, Everton made plenty of noise over the summer transfer window with Keane just one of the club s many expensive acquisitions, And in our eyes he was worth every penny, With points on Dream Team already this season and priced at a fairly affordable m we think it s high time you splashed out on the ex Burnley defender for your fantasy football team, His first real test in Everton blue will come this weekend when the Toffees take on Chelsea, How will he handle Alvaro Morata, We can hardly wait to find out, Scoff all you want but if Arsenal are going to climb themselves out of this slump then they ll need to get the best out of players like Ozil, Luckily the midfield maestro goes into Gameweek off the back of an eye catching performance for Germany during the international break scoring an incredible goal in their demolition of Norway, If he can recapture that form for the Gunners this weekend against Bournemouth then we ll be willing to forget all of that deadline day unpleasantness for another week at least, We genuinely spent all summer long dreaming about Sanches joining a Premier League club, Our money was on Chelsea or maybe Manchester United, But Swansea, Mind blown, With the Portuguese wonderkid looking to recapture some of his pre Bayern Munich form under the watchful eye of Paul Clement we simply have how he s going to do, But priced at measly m on Dream Team we re willing to take a gamble, From one lad with plenty of potential to another, Watford s newest fan favourite is certainly one to watch this season with the Hornets ringing in a new era under Marco Silva, Following their draw against Brighton a fortnight ago Watford travel to Southampton this weekend, And having already opened his goal scoring account in the Premier League Richarlison will be keen to test himself against a Saints side who have already kept two cleansheets this season, We all said that Aguero would struggle for game time this season, On the contrary he s played aplenty so far, And with Man City up against Liverpool in Saturday s early kick off we think Pep Guardiola might capitalise on Liverpool s dodgy defence by playing Aguero alongside Gabriel Jesus in a two man attack, We re already rubbing our hands together in anticipation, This transfer recommendation is specifically for those of you who have Kyle Walker in your side, The former Spurs man is suspended for City s trip to Bournemouth this weekend having picked up a red card in Man City s last game against Everton, Fortunately for the price of Walker you can transfer in his teammate Otamendi who continues to rake in those sweet fantasy football points, He s scored points on Dream Team so far this season and has proven time and time again to be a fantasy football gem, With the Cherries yet to score this season we think City defenders are worth, The man everyone is talking about on fantasy football this season is Hegazi, The West Brom man helped his new club start their campaign with back to back clean sheets and even scored the winner against Bournemouth in Gameweek, He currently tops the total points chart on Dream Team with points with Tony Pulis side facing his former employers Stoke City this weekend at the Hawthorns, Will it be another three points and a cleansheet for the Baggies, After two wins from their opening two games in the big league it s time to take David Wagner s Huddersfield side seriously, Aaron Mooy was the hero against Newcastle last time out while striker Steve Mounie could be one of the fantasy football picks of the season, And keeping things tidy at the back for the Terriers so far is German defender Schindler, The centre back was the club s Mr Reliable during their successful Championship campaign last season and continues to impress in the Premier League, Can Huddersfield continue their bright start to the season against Southamtpon on Saturday, If we learned anything from Liverpool s clash against Crystal Palace last weekend it s that Jurgen Klopp will be heavily rotating his squad this season, We were all a little gutted when we saw Mohamed Salah sitting on the bench at Anfield but with the Reds important Champions League tie against Hoffenheim during the week the decision was justified, However up against Arsenal this weekend Klopp will need all the fire power he can muster so we fully expect a strong albeit slightly fatigued Liverpool line up, And with Mane starring in the game against the German side who better to put the sword to the Gunners, Our favourite Armenian in the whole wide world continues to impress having notched four assists already this season, If that wasn t enough he s won the Star Man award in each of Manchester United s opening two Premier League fixtures, With United up against Leicester on Saturday evening you know what to do, It s not been the best of starts for West Ham this season but at least Hammers fans can take solace in the fact that Hernandez is already off the mark, The Mexican scored twice in their loss against Southampton last weekend amassing a tasty points in the process, Up against equally hapless Newcastle this weekend we can see the former Man United poacher putting on his goalscorer boots once again, Watford fans have lots to be optimistic about this season, With a young exciting manager in the form Marco Silva taking charge of the club over the summer joined by the likes of Nathaniel Chalobah and Will Hughes times ahead look promising for the Hornets, But the one to watch this weekend is Brazilian forward Richarlison who scored his first goal for the side last week, Up against Brighton we re expecting him to get plenty of chances, That s the beauty of Dream Team Weekender there are no budget limitations so you can pick any player available from this weekend s fixtures with Man City v Liverpool the pick of the bunch, Weekender is the best new fantasy football game around and it s to enter, Just select seven players from across the Saturday and Sunday Premier League fixtures for your chance to bag that tasty, Flopped last week It doesn t matter as Weekender allows you to start afresh every single weekend Let the games

leaking the personal information of million people without their permission, Zuck will stay in his exquisite house in Palo Alto California where a voice controlled app called Jarvis makes his toast picks him a trademark grey T shirt and switches on the outdoor fireplace, Instead the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport DCMS will have to make do with Facebook s chief product officer or its chief technology officer, Or maybe Jarvis if Zuckerberg can teach his toy to explain why Facebook happily sold shedloads of intimate data to a British firm Cambridge Analytica, Zuckerberg hid away after a revealed last week that the company used Facebook users data to target their inner demons, The story Zuckerberg worried about his personal fortune of billion that s fifty billion quid not bad for a year old then said he was happy to testify if it s the right thing to do, Now surprise surprise he s decided it s not the right thing to do, But sucking up and selling on the personal

tags=[7, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1], url_data=[Composed and confident Socceroos light years ahead of Norway shambles, They rode their luck at times but the performance against Colombia was of considerable merit, at Craven Cottage, he daggers were already out for Bert van Marwijk after in Oslo With limited preparation time the Socceroos were disjointed and listless in a drubbing at the hands of a lower ranked opponent The Dutchman got several of his selections wrong and Australia appeared a side unsure of what to do against a predictable old fashioned side content to lump the ball long Normally predictable and dependable players made simple mistakes and looked all at sea It was arguably the national team s worst defeat for some time, Much improved Socceroos hold their own in goalless draw with Colombia, Fears mounted about what the year old from Deventer famed for his pragmatism and do whatever it takes to get the job done mentality would do to Ange Postecoglou s all attacking full pressing team Would the Socceroos just park the bus and hope for the best in Russia instead of the bold and spirited display we saw in Brazil Was a World Cup whitewash on the cards Many of those concerns some clearly over the top have been allayed and daggers sheathed in London Facing a team ranked in the world one that reached the last eight of the World Cup boasts players on the books of Bayern Munich Arsenal Milan Barcelona Tottenham and Sampdoria and beat France in Paris only four days ago there were worries the Socceroos could be well and truly blown off the park at Craven Cottage, But Van Marwijk s team stood up to Los Cafeteros in a see sawing minutes in south west London While certainly they rode their luck at times and had a left post and a dynamic Danny Vukovic dive to thank for keeping Miguel Borja at bay this was a Socceroos performance of considerable merit Not only did the Australians look composed and confident in their new formation but their speed of play and passing was light years ahead of that seen in their ordinary Oslo outing, Even the lack of Aaron Mooy arguably Australia s form player with Huddersfield Town didn t derail them The back four was compact and unforgiving while Massimo Luongo was a revelation in Mooy s spot The QPR midfielder had a hand in everything and showed why he deserves a regular place in Van Marwijk s starting XI, The return of Tomi Juric to lead the frontline added some experience and allowed Andrew Nabbout to move back to his familiar position on the wing Having Tom Rogic in the No role instead of makeshift playmaker Jackson Irvine meant the Socceroos held the ball better and created more opportunities in the final third, In Norway they barely mustered a shot on goal but against Colombia chances fell to Juric Nabbout Luongo and Matthew Leckie Aziz Behich was a handful for them to contain and Josh Ridson put in a good sift Even though the South Americans dominated possession enjoying of the ball and Borja and James Rodr guez left their finishing boots at home there was renewed steel and intensity from the Socceroos, The jump of in class of Colombia along with a raucous atmosphere more like a World Cup game than the stale environment in Norway s Ullevaal Stadion rubbed off on They lifted and performed accordingly Those rose to the challenge and showed why on their day they can challenge some of the best teams in the world More time on the training park and more time for Van Marwijk to get his messages across led to a more professional eye catching display A month long camp in Turkey combined with two more friendlies against European nations is still to come and can only be beneficial along with the return of Trent Sainsbury, Atrocious result against Norway does not bode well for Socceroos Jonathan Howcroft, The Socceroos are not the finished article yet and have a way to go But doom and gloom about the upcoming World Cup campaign is unfounded With more time with his players Van Marwijk can get his vision fit and firing on all cylinders It may not be the evangelic and idealised outfit of Postecoglou but it will be one that Australia can still be proud of And maybe one that can match the famed feats of the Golden Generation and get out of the group stage, The former Netherlands coach has already given four debuts in two matches installed a new tactical system and refreshed the Socceroos training camp Players have spoken about the fun and relaxed atmosphere that exists already under him compared with the tense and strained mood of the Postecoglou era Postecoglou liked to remain distant from his players and keep them on their toes in a bid to create an edgy environment, But Van Marwijk is all about keeping his cattle content and comfortable The early signs are that this different approach this changing of the guard can actually bear fruit If the Socceroos can do it against Colombia then matching France Denmark and Peru in three month s time is not beyond their grasp]}}

deliberately being racist, Share this with, Email, Facebook, Messenger, Messenger, Twitter, Pinterest, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Copy this link, These are external links and will open in a new window, Several big brands have been labelled racist recently after releasing adverts which have backfired, H M apologised in January for modelling a hoodie which had coolest monkey in the jungle on the front following a huge backlash, Dove soap said sorry a few months earlier for that appeared to show a black woman turning into a white person, And Chance the Rapper has terribly racist claiming that brands are purposely putting out noticeably racist ads so they can get more views, But is there any truth in his claim, Paul MacKenzie Cummins managing director of Clearly PR Marketing and Communications thinks some brands are using race to grab people s attention, They re clever people those who work in ad agencies They re very skilled and have huge budgets and are under increasing pressure to raise the profile of their client s brand, It s an ultra competitive market and the retail space has never been as competitive as what it is now They need to do something to get their voices seen and heard, Paul who worked in advertising for years thinks the approach will ultimately damage a brand s reputation, To a degree Chance is kind of right in the sense that it s deliberately being provocative and it s trying to get the headlines and it s working in that respect That s the key word respect That s what it comes back down to, And this ultimately is going to be much more damaging for brands than what they actually realise, The UK s advertising watchdog the Advertising Standards Authority ASA has received racism complaints since about different ads, Of those cases were formally investigated and of those had the complaint upheld, The ASA has the power to ban adverts it thinks breaches its standards, One of its most recent cases was a complaint against Paddy Power for an advert featuring boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr which encouraged readers to always bet on black, It because it was likely to cause serious offence on the grounds of race and told the bookies not to make the same mistake again, Kubi Springer is the founder of global branding agency She Builds Brands and has worked with the likes of L Oreal and the Mobo Awards, She says that despite adverts being looked at by lots of people before they make it to the public a lack of diversity in advertising agencies means things can be missed, I wouldn t go as far as to say brands are making innocent mistakes but also wouldn t go as far as Chance the Rapper and say they are being deliberately racist, You need people at management and senior manager level that are diverse and that s both ethnicity as well as the LGBT community as well as women who will say Actually this might offend a particular demographic and maybe you should think about this again, A by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising found that of employees in the ad industry were from a black or ethnic minority background, Sarah Jenkins the chief marketing officer at advertising agency Grey London doesn t believe any brand would put out a racist ad on purpose, Her agency has set up a diversity task force which has the support of around advertising agencies to help the industry attract more representative employees, Like Kubi she thinks a lack of diversity within the industry means some brands may not realise their ads could be seen as inappropriate, She says Although we re seeing some bad campaigns there are some brilliant agencies and initiatives in place, I think what we ve done with the diversity task force is pull together the biggest and most forward thinking ad agencies in the UK and we re working together and using our skills to attract the best talent, That s not because we re worried about getting things wrong it s a more positive reason It s because when we are diverse we get better ideas we get different perspectives and different approaches and the work simply gets better, , , Related Topics, Share this story, More on this story, Top Stories, Italy reacts angrily as customs officers enter a migrant

News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media news education and information services, Follow The Sun, The Sun, News Corp, Services, Out of control TONNE Chinese space station Tiangong will give splendid show when it crash lands on Earth this weekend, Experts say the plummeting space craft will light up the sky like a meteor shower as it burns through the Earth s atmosphere somewhere between today and Easter Monday, THE out of control Chinese space station heading for Earth this weekend is expected to put on a splendid show according to experts, The Tiangong space craft is expected to tear across the sky similar to that of a meteor shower once it plummets into the Earth s atmosphere somewhere between today and Easter Monday, Chinese authorities say it is unlikely the nine tonne space station will cause any damage, Holger Krag head of the European Space Agency said If you re in the right place at the right times and the sky is clear it will be quite spectacular, The ESA is currently predicting a narrower window of tonight to late Sunday evening, It will be visible to the naked eye even in daylight and look like a slow moving shooting star that splits into a few more shooting stars You might even see a smoke trial, , The x ft space craft about the size of a school bus was launched back in but has since lost connection with China s space agency and is now falling out of orbit, The space craft s descent is currently being tracked by Aerospace engineering and the ESA and say it is currently dropping out of orbit by about miles a day, Zhu Congpeng from China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporate said We have been continuously monitoring Tiangong and expect to allow it to fall within the first half of this year, It will burn up on entering the atmosphere and the remaining wreckage will fall into a designated area of the sea without endangering the surface, The odds of being struck by a space debris are one in trillion, Tiangong which means heavenly palace in Chinese is carrying a highly toxic chemical called hydrazine, The material is used as rocket fuel but exposure to humans is believed to cause symptoms like nausea and seizures with long term contact said to cause cancer, The good news is that it s very unlikely that anyone will actually get hit by the spacecraft which is expected to break up into debris upon re entry, A statement from the non profit Aerospace Corporation explains When considering the worst case location the probability that a specific person will be struck by Tiangong debris is about one million times smaller than the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot, In the history of spaceflight no known person has ever been harmed by re entering space debris, Only one person has ever been recorded as being hit by a piece of space debris and fortunately she was not injured, MOST READ IN TECH, CRACKING UP, TIN HATS AT THE READY, CYBER SAFE, CORE OF THE PROBLEM, KIDS NEW OBSESSION, The ESA s Holger Krag told Newsweek Owing to the geometry of the station s orbit we can already exclude the possibility that any fragments will fall over any spot further north than N or further south than S, This means that re entry may take place over any spot on Earth between these latitudes which includes several European countries for example, The date time and geographic footprint of the re entry can only be predicted with large uncertainties, Even shortly before re entry only a very large time and geographical window can be estimated, , Comments, Most Popular, RAPE MOB, Mob parade men

are external links and will open in a new window, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has returned to her hometown in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot there by the Taliban, Ms Yousafzai who now lives in the UK was shot in the head for campaigning for female education in, Her family s home region of Swat was once a militant stronghold and she was attacked on a school bus there at, It had been unclear if the year old would visit the area because of security concerns, On Thursday it was announced that Ms Yousafzai had returned to Pakistan for the first time since she was attacked, When I gave my first talk I just could not stop my tears It is emotional she told the BBC I m just so happy to be home and to put my feet on this land again, A helicopter carrying Ms Yousafzai landed not far from her family home in Mingora on Saturday amid a tight security operation, She then spoke at an all boys school just outside of the town, My dream has come true Peace has returned to Swat because of the invaluable sacrifices rendered by my brothers and sisters she said, Her trip to Pakistan is expected to last four days Officials from her Malala Fund group are travelling with her local media report, Why was she attacked, Ms Yousafzai was only years old when she began writing an anonymous diary about life under the Taliban for BBC Urdu that captivated audiences, She wrote about militant suppression and championed the right to education for girls in Pakistan, But she was also unafraid to speak publicly about these issues This drew the attention of the Taliban militants who were active in the region and her family soon began receiving death threats, I was concerned about her security Pakistani television presenter Hamid Mir told the BBC in, On the afternoon of October Ms Yousafzai walked out of school as normal and boarded a small bus waiting outside, Soon after two militants boarded the bus before one asked Who is Malala They shot her in the head Two of her friends were also injured, The teenager sustained life threatening injuries and spent weeks in intensive care before having part of her skull removed to relieve swelling on her brain, The attack stunned Pakistan many people did not believe the Taliban would target a child and catapulted Ms Yousafzai to international fame, The Pakistani Taliban said they had shot her because she was promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas, What has she done since, Since her recovery Ms Yousafzai has continued to speak up for children s education and rights around the world, She set up the Malala Fund with her father Ziauddin with the goal of working for a world where every girl can learn and lead without fear, years ago I was shot in an attempt to stop me from speaking out for girls education Today I attend my first lectures at Oxford, End of Twitter post by Malala, In she became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize She and Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi were jointly awarded it for their efforts for children s rights, She has continued campaigning while pursuing her studies and is now reading Politics Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University, Ms Yousafzai says she plans to return to Pakistan permanently once she has completed her degree, How is she viewed in Pakistan, Ms Yousafzai remains a polarising figure in Pakistan While the majority of people support her she is the subject of fierce criticism from those who say she is shaming her country, She is often targeted with online abuse by conservatives who believe she is following what they see as a Western agenda, For them women getting an education is daunting and dangerous especially in rural areas where millions of girls drop out of school and end up doing household work says BBC Urdu editor Haroon Rashid, A group of private schools in Pakistan declared Friday to be I Am Not Malala Day A spokesman for the schools said they disagreed with her anti Islam and anti Pakistan ideology, But this criticism comes as a surprise to Ms Yousafzai, I don t understand Why do they oppose me What is the reason behind it she said in an interview with the BBC, I do not even look at these comments Maybe they would hope that I see but I don t see, She added The only thing I would say is that I love Pakistan and I am Pakistani and I want a better future for this country, Related

Sun, News Corp, Services, Four proud new mums show off real post baby bodies after Kylie Jenner posed with flat stomach one month after birth, We speak to four women who think new mums should take more pride in their altered figures, SMUG celebrities cannot get enough of sticking sleek post baby body snaps online just weeks after giving birth, Kylie Jenner did so on Snapchat recently wearing only knickers and a crop top above just a month after her daughter Stormi was born, Critics claimed the shots could make other new mums feel inadequate, But rather than moan about the star some new mothers would prefer to post their own far more realistic snaps of their new figures, Here four women who have given birth in the past six months show off their mum bods and tell JENNY FRANCIS and SAMANTHA BRICK why they believe other recent mothers should take pride in their figures, Claire Bentley, My body isn t perfect but I m very happy and grateful with how I look after giving birth to two children, Before becoming pregnant I was a size six I m naturally slim and carried no weight on my hips or tummy at all while my breasts were tiny, After childbirth I m only a size eight but I have stretch marks curves where I had none before and wobbly bits everywhere, My boobs have shrunk even more They went from an A cup to a C cup and now back to an A which was a surprise, At first I was a little bit uncomfortable with the changes but I m much more accepting of my body now, When I go swimming with Imogen I don t have a problem showing off my stretch marks, I m doing the diet eating within an eight hour period then fasting for hours and when Jasmine naps I do a high intensity interval training workout, My mum and I are really close and I took a lot cues from her She prepared me for the changes my body would undergo after pregnancy and childbirth and I m always asking her questions, It s a massive help that my husband Matthew is always telling me how great I look, There s real pressure on social media to only post pictures of specific body types The reality is most mums don t look like that and all different shapes are just as beautiful, Jasmine Mbye, I didn t put on much weight during pregnancy although I made a point not to look at my weight in my maternity notes and not step on the scales at home I didn t see the point worrying about the numbers, Since I gave birth I ve noticed my thighs are bigger My body hasn t snapped back into shape like celebrities claim and my tummy still bulges so I look a bit pregnant, I had pert breasts before and now they re bigger and have dropped While half of me desperately wants my pre pregnancy body back the other side tells me to chill out It s only been a few months, I remind myself of my gorgeous baby girl and realise how much I love her and that makes me love my body I m a first time mum and an older mum too so I accept my body will be more vulnerable to change, Family and friends are very supportive telling me I look good And although my husband made a joke about me still looking pregnant he also tells me I m sexy, It s important for us mums to show off our bodies so other mums can feel confident about theirs too, Vanesa Macia Domene, Women have it a lot harder today than our mums did Previous generations were expected to be bigger and dress in baggy shirts during the first year of their baby s life, Today we are constantly made to feel like we re supposed to immediately slim down That is physically impossible for most of us including me, Celebrity mums such as Kylie Jenner and Ferne McCann don t help by parading their thin bodies in selfies on social media barely a month after giving birth, Seeing that sort of thing while I m still having to wear my maternity clothes certainly doesn t make things any easier Before I became a mum I was a size eight but now I m more than a stone heavier and three dress sizes up, My breasts and my tummy are a lot bigger than I expected them to be but I m slowly but surely getting used to how I look, Part of me wants to lose weight but the other part wants to enjoy these precious moments with my baby He comes first, I don t have time for exercise and don t want to put pressure on myself to change too quickly, Unlike celebs who rush to change I think it s important to give your body time to recover, That s why showing my body after pregnancy is important It lets other people know the realities of pregnancy and birth, I m really lucky that my partner is so supportive and he loves me the way I am, Claire Reynolds, I knew my body would change with pregnancy but it s been a more extreme change than I had ever imagined, I have put on weight in all the usual places such as my hips and have gone up three dress sizes much more than I thought, But being bigger doesn t faze me as I m lucky to have Ella Maria, I had an ectopic pregnancy six years ago and one of my Fallopian tubes was removed so it s a miracle I fell pregnant again, That s why any negative thoughts about my bigger body immediately get pushed out of my mind, On days when I wish I fitted into my old skinny jeans my partner Luke helps me to focus on the positives and that really helps me to stop fretting, My best friend was worried I d panic about being bigger but she is proud of how I appreciate my body for what it s achieved, I go to a slimming club to make sure I eat healthily, MOST READ IN FABULOUS, NO JOKE, BARGAIN BLING, Your Round, Eye watering, THINKING POSITIVE, DEBORAH JAMES, I don t want my daughter to grow up hearing me moan about my figure If I have a positive outlook about my body then she ll have one too, Celebrities only show off their post pregnancy pictures when they think they ve slimmed down, However I think that more people should show their body off when they are still naturally recovering It would be a lot closer to reality, I had a C section during the birth and whenever I see the smiling scar on my body it s as a reminder

benefit your health it may help heal wounds resistant to antibiotics, As a child growing up in poverty in the rural Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe Moses Murandu was used to having salt literally rubbed in his wounds when he fell and cut himself On lucky days though his father had enough money to buy something which stung the boy much less than salt sugar, Murandu always noticed that sugar seemed to help heal wounds more quickly than no treatment at all So he was surprised when having been recruited to come to work as a nurse for the UK s National Health System NHS in he found that sugar wasn t being used in any official capacity He decided to try to change that, Now Murandu s idea finally is being taken seriously A senior lecturer in adult nursing at the University of Wolverhampton Murandu completed an initial focussed on sugar s applications in wound healing and won an award from the Journal of Wound Care in March for his work, Are you ready to unlock Britain s best kept secrets, London and surrounds offer an irresistible cacophony of nightlife food and drink natural wonders and world leading culture for you to check out We ve delved into London and its neighbouring cities of Brighton Bristol Liverpool and Manchester all within approximately hours to unlock their best kept secrets Whether you re in town for a couple of hours a few days or a week allow yourself to be swept up by Britain s allure, , , In some parts of the world this procedure could be key because people cannot afford antibiotics But there is interest in the UK too since once a wound is infected, To treat a wound with sugar all you do Murandu says is pour the sugar on the wound and apply a bandage on top The granules soak up any moisture that allows bacteria to thrive Without the bacteria the wound heals more quickly, Evidence for all of this was found in Murandu s trials in the lab And a growing collection of case studies from around the world has supported Murandu s findings including examples of on wounds resistant to antibiotics Even so Murandu faces an uphill battle Funding for further research would help him reach his ultimate goal to convince the NHS to use sugar as an alternative to antibiotics But a great deal of medical research is funded by pharmaceutical companies And these companies he points out have little to gain from paying for research into something they can t patent, The sugar is the plain granulated type you might use to sweeten your tea, The sugar Murandu uses is the plain granulated type you might use to sweeten your tea In the same in vitro trials he found that there was no difference between using cane or beet sugar Demerara however wasn t as effective, The pilot showed that strains of bacteria grew in low concentrations of sugar but were completely inhibited in higher concentrations Murandu started recording case studies in Zimbabwe Botswana and Lesotho where he first trained in nursing Included among them is a woman living in Harare, The woman s foot had been measured ready to be amputated when my nephew called me Murandu says She had had a terrible wound for five years and the doctor wanted to amputate I told her to wash the wound apply sugar leave it and repeat, The woman still has her leg, This he says is one example of why there is so much interest in his methods particularly from parts of the world where people can t afford antibiotics, In total Murandu has now carried out clinical studies on patients in the UK He hasn t yet published the trial results but has presented them at national and international conferences One question he had to answer during his research was whether sugar could be used on diabetic patients who commonly have leg and foot ulcers Diabetics need to control the level of glucose in their blood so this isn t an obvious healing method to use on them, But he found that it worked for diabetics without sending their glucose levels soaring Sugar is sucrose you need the enzyme sucrase to convert that into glucose he says As sucrase is found within the body it is only when the sugar is absorbed that it is converted Applying it to the outside of the wound isn t going to affect it in the same way, While Murandu continues his research on human patients across the Atlantic US veterinarian Maureen McMichael has been using this healing method on animals for years, McMichael who works at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital first started using both sugar and honey on pets back in She said it was a combination of the simplicity of the method and the low cost that attracted her especially for pet owners who couldn t afford the usual methods of bringing the animal to the hospital and using sedation, McMichael says that they keep both sugar and honey in their surgery and often used it on dogs and cats and occasionally on farm animals Honey has similar healing properties to sugar found it to be even more effective at inhibiting bacterial growth though it is more expensive, We have had some really great successes with this McMichael says She gave an example of a stray dog that had come to them after being used as pitbull bait hung from a harness and attacked by pitbulls being trained for fighting The dog came in with up to bite wounds on each limb and was healed within eight weeks, She was a stray so there was no money for her We treated her with both honey and sugar and she did fabulously McMichael says She s all healed now, As well as being cheaper sugar has another upside as more and more antibiotics are used we are becoming resistant to them, As well as being cheaper sugar has another upside as more and more antibiotics are used we are becoming resistant to them, Back in the UK tissue engineering specialist Sheila MacNeil of the University of Sheffeld has researched how naturally occurring sugars can be used to stimulate the re growth of blood vessels Her research stemmed from from her work on tumours when she noticed that one particular small sugar derived from the breakdown of DNA deoxy D ribose kept cropping up MacNeil s team experimented by to the membrane surrounding chick embryos According to MacNeil the sugar stimulated double the number of blood vessels than would grow without it, But of course these types of naturally occurring sugars found in our bodies are a long way from the type of everyday sugar used by Murandu in his experiments The dream ticket MacNeil says would be to find a sugar that could be used in both ways She believes this is the next step research should take, Meanwhile in Wolverhampton Murandu s plan is to set up a private clinic using his sugar method He hopes that one day sugar will be commonly used not only by the NHS but also at public hospitals in some of the other countries where he has been working He continues to get regular emails from around the world asking for his advice and guides patients remotely over email and texting His far away clients send him photos of their results along with their gratitude when they are healed, It is an ancient method and one used unofficially by many poor people in developing countries but for Murandu it was only by coming to the UK that he realised the significance sugar could have in the medical world He sees it as a blending of his local knowledge with the modern research facilities in Britain, Like sugar the knowledge came raw from Zimbabwe was refined here and is now going back to help people in Africa he says, , Follow BBC Future, Explore the BBC]}}

Editions, News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media news education and information services, Follow The Sun, The Sun, News Corp, Services, It s OK to have a favourite child and here s how to handle it, Our parenting expert gives you practical psychological insights to handle family favouritism in the healthiest way, ALTHOUGH many parents would never openly admit it they do prefer one of their kids over the other, A recent survey has found one in five parents DO have a favourite child, For some it is the first born for others it is the baby of the family or just the child who is most similar to themselves, Here parenting expert LIAT HUGHES JOSHI looks at how to handle family favouritism in the healthiest way, FAVOURITE AND NON FAVOURITES LOSE OUT, A parent s special child might feel good about their status but obvious favouritism can be as harmful for them as it is for their siblings, Psychologist Dr Amanda Gummer says The favourite may feel pressure to succeed and not have space to experiment if they fear disappointing and losing their status, They can also miss out on learning from childhood battles if you are always taking their side, Meanwhile their siblings might develop self esteem issues believing they aren t so important or loved with the impact potentially lasting into adulthood, DON T DENY FAVOURITISM TO YOURSELF, Having a preferred child isn t socially acceptable leaving us feeling guilty and possibly in denial, Of course you shouldn t admit it to your kids if you have a preferred child although they will spot it if you aren t careful But pretending this isn t the case to yourself helps no one, By being aware of any favouritism you can look at ways to prevent and counter any ill effects It is how you deal with such emotions that matters more than whether you have them in the first place, BE FAIR, Make it clear you love all your kids via your words and actions and give them roughly equal amounts of attention money and decision making opportunities whenever possible, If there is a good reason for differences maybe one of your children is having a tougher time at the moment and needs more support or leeway explain this to the others, EMBRACE DIFFERENCES, You don t have to treat your kids identically to be fair with spending and attention, It is fine to enjoy different activities with each child based on their interests and personalities, You might prefer shopping with one but bond more through humour or sport with another, MOST READ IN FABULOUS, NO JOKE, BARGAIN BLING, Your Round, Eye watering, THINKING POSITIVE, DEBORAH JAMES, WATCH OUT FOR OVER COMPARING, It s natural to make comparisons about our kids to ourselves or our partners but constant comments complimenting one child s appearance brains or behaviour over a sibling s can be especially damaging, Try to compare each child to themselves and their own potential instead For example try saying Maybe you could have done

that the Austrian bundled home at the second attempt, Arnautovic added his second in first half stoppage time volleying home another fine cross this time from the left flank by Arthur Masuaku, The players were great Their prep over the last few weeks their attitude has been great they wanted to put past events behind them Moyes added, We think we re good enough to be clear of the bottom three Recent results haven t been good but we played well, Southampton were dire in Mark Hughes first league game in charge and remain in the relegation zone two points from safety, Victory for West Ham takes them up to th five points clear of Saints in th, Gloom lifted at London Stadium, There were protests outside of the ground and a heavily increased security presence inside but the difference in the atmosphere from, In toxic scenes during the defeat to Burnley fans invaded the field threw missiles and protested against the club s board but at full time on Saturday there was a celebratory mood as the crowd gave the players a standing ovation from the field, West Ham s joint owners David Sullivan and David Gold were in attendance but watched the game away from the directors box where they previously received abuse although the home fans passion was channelled in supporting their team throughout as captain, Moyes side dominated proceedings particularly in the first half during which they had nine of their shots and were fully deserving of their three goal winning margin, They outplayed Southampton in central midfield and each goal came from excellent team play, Mario on loan from Inter Milan was a constant threat and Masuaku drove down the left wing at will on his return from a six game ban while Arnautovic was a clinical spearhead up front, Arnautovic makes his point to Hughes, Arnautovic celebrated his first goal in the direction of Hughes who when in charge of Stoke last summer, It was his second against a Hughes managed team this season having also scored in in December and he celebrated with crossed arms a reference to the crossed irons in West Ham s crest, They have worked together over the years Arnautovic and Hughes Marko is that type Moyes said, People who have worked with him know that they will tell you, Hughes said after the game that he wasn t aware of the Arnautovic s gesture, My relationship with Marko Arnautovic when I worked with him at Stoke was very good you ll have to ask him about that goal celebration he said, I don t know if he was pointing at me or was just excited by scoring, Big problems for Hughes and Southampton, Hughes was appointed Southampton manager earlier this month tasked with achieving Premier League safety in the eight remaining games, He secured an FA Cup semi final with victory over Wigan in his first game in charge but in east London oversaw one of Saints worst performances of the season, They were toothless in attack and did not force West Ham goalkeeper Joe Hart to make a save in the minutes, In the first half they had just two touches in the West Ham penalty area and consistently misplaced passes with their passing accuracy at one point below, They have won just once in their last Premier League matches and five of their remaining seven games are against teams in the top half of the table, We were poor Hughes said The opening minutes of any game is key you have to manage it correctly and we damaged ourselves, We conceded poor goals and gave us too much to do, The Saints welcomed back striker Charlie Austin who remains the club s top scorer this season despite having not played since December but failed to score for a third league game in a row, We have to find a way to score goals Hughes said, If you can t get a foothold in the game by working hard and winning the right to play you are not going to create chances We have to understand that we are in a situation of our own making, Analysis, It is far too simplistic to say all West Ham s problems at London Stadium could be solved by a few wins, Over a four hour period before kick off I saw a lot of fans male and female young and old vent their frustrations at a variety of issues about the club from improving the feel of the stadium to getting rid of the owners completely, But there is no doubt either what was always going to be a tough transition from the earthy and nostalgic Upton Park to the white almost corporate London Stadium from West Ham s traditional home to one they don t actually own would have been a lot smoother had their form been better here, Three nil is not a massive score But it is the joint record West Ham have achieved in almost two seasons at the stadium Brighton and Burnley between them have done the same here this season alone, Once again the first half proved a winning team can generate an atmosphere too, Today s result will generate some momentum For West Ham s sake they must keep it going, Man of the match Marko Arnautovic, Hart s long wait the best stats, What s next,

revealed the social network s ruthless pursuit of growth over user safety, Titled The Ugly the memo dates back to but has been kept secret until today when circulated it, We connect people Period That s why all the work we do in growth is justified writes Boz in the memo, Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools, The top level Facebook exec also defended the company s data practices which are being scrutinised in the wake of its latest, Anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good he wrote, All the questionable contact importing practices All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends All of the work we do to bring more communication in, Bosworth quickly distanced himself from the comments, My statement on the recent Buzzfeed story containing a post I wrote in, Boz boztank, I don t agree with the post today and I didn t agree with it even when I wrote it he said on Twitter, The purpose of this post like many others I have written internally was to bring to the surface issues I felt deserved more discussion with the broader company, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has defended Boz in a statement while distancing himself from the memo, Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly said Zuckerberg, We ve never believed the ends justify the means We recognize that connecting people isn t enough by itself, We also need to work to bring people closer together We changed our whole mission and company focus to reflect this last year, Rewind to and Facebook was riding high while other tech companies floundered, Revenue had skyrocketed by percent year over year and the company had raked in billion in the first three months of that year alone, It also added users in the short period bringing its tally to billion it has since gone on to amass billion members worldwide, Therefore it s easy to see why Boz was so bullish But the leak s timing couldn t be any worse, Most read in tech, CRACKING UP, TIN HATS AT THE READY, WATCH OUT, CYBER SAFE, CORE OF THE PROBLEM, KIDS NEW OBSESSION, Today Facebook is embroiled in its biggest ever privacy scandal after it was recently revealed that had bought the data of million Facebook users that was obtained

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6], url_data=[Accessibility links, BBC navigation, A father and son pilgrimage on the Tour du Mont Blanc, Before it was too late writer Mike MacEacheran made a family pilgrimage to the Alps to connect with his father s wanderlust and retrace the steps taken years before he was born, It was on a grey winter s day in my parents house outside Glasgow watching storm clouds gather and sparrows dive for shelter in the garden that I first suggested Mont Blanc in summer After what had happened I knew I should make more effort to spend time with my year old dad but what I was proposing at his age was a risk A day hike around one of Europe s highest mountains seemed a little extreme, Old age doesn t come alone he replied implying the aches and pains arthritic hands and memory loss from a recent life threatening stroke couldn t be ignored, He glanced at me with a fatherly look suggesting he knew better I wondered if he could make it In his youth unquestionably but now I wasn t so sure Perhaps a trip hiking Mont Blanc s steep faced valleys following a hut to hut trail through France Italy and Switzerland was already past him, , Now a grandfather he had spent his best years in the Alps summer after summer in fact and to take him along this pathway in search of a route to his past to stir memory in long forgotten footprints seemed like the right thing to do, You ll remember the mountain refuges are beautiful I said casually compelled to disturb what lay hidden in his memory That s half the reason for going It was shrewd of me to work in the idea of fondue red wine and good company we booked a flight and four months later arrived in the shadow of Mont Blanc m in Chamonix France, The Tour du Mont Blanc is a challenge for anyone regardless of age condition or state of mind A bucket list pilgrimage for long distance hikers it is a km high altitude journey on foot a ritual walk through great landscapes and drama that plugs hikers in to something unquantifiable yet life affirming While I travelled for a love of people food drink and culture my father had always been drawn to places that weren t as easily accessible The mountains appealed because of their unreachability Hikers he once told me came to learn about themselves, That first sunlit afternoon it was instantly obvious we d made the right decision The pathway ahead was quiet little more than a few bell clanging cows a couple of errant dogs a rosy cheeked French farmer en route to his summer cottage Hedgerows and thickets of wild Alpenrose lined the trail s edges On the horizon stone faced peaks sat above the plateau skirted by pine forests and chequerboard fields Quick footed hikers trotted past us eyes focused on a ridge that marched south to the Italian border But there was no sign of worry etched on my hiking partner s brow Only determination, My dad s hazy accounts of his time in the mountains remain among the defining stories of my childhood The first time it left an indelible mark was when flicking through a junk box full of projector slides taken circa summer when he and two friends completed a previously untried route up the notoriously dangerous North Face of the Eiger m in Switzerland s Bernese Oberland At the time he was and to scale the final m North Pillar wall on the way to the summit was unthinkable The extreme highs and lows were not easy for him to recount Along the way he suffered frostbite dealt with unexpectedly bad weather and bivouacked night after night in sodden climbing gear on treacherous ice coated vertical slabs Afterwards he was quoted by The Herald newspaper the expedition s sponsor saying I ll never set foot on that bloody mountain again in my life, What I d always seen as an unhealthy obsession with the mountains revealed itself to be a bond I never knew we had, Still today it s almost inconceivable for me to comprehend, In those days there were other equally spellbinding tales most of which took him to the Chamonix valley He summited the Grandes Jorasses m in blinding sunshine He scaled the ice walls of the Aiguille du Chardonnet m Hell on one occasion he even posed atop the remarkable Aiguille du Gr pon m a fist of angular rock crafted like a church spire an exploit that would test the mettle of even the most carefree climber To an eight year old boy these were unforgettable adventures shaping my travel perceptions in years to come, That was now more than half his lifetime ago And yet here we were marching side by side around the Mont Blanc massif tracing an invisible route with our fingers over the same harsh and elemental summits he d conquered long ago What I d always seen as an unhealthy obsession with the mountains revealed itself to be a bond I never knew we had, As day one drifted into days two and three we crossed from France into Italy over the Col de la Seigne a crested hilltop long an ancient gateway for shepherds to the Aosta Valley The southern aspect of Mont Blanc and its fraternity of Italian set buttresses and peaks Punta Baretti Picco Luigi Amedeo the Grand Pilier d Angle were spectacular and had him reminiscing over a glass of wine in the resort of Courmayeur on our third night Never one with words he was hard pushed to explain why these landscapes meant so much to him Words failed and he shook his head as if to free a lost memory, The days passed and began to take on a predictable rhythm the path carrying us ever forward We rose late left later stalled by having to medicate my dad with a daily dose of pills stopped for lunch then enjoyed a beer on the back of a farmer s wagon Finally after some km of up and downhill slog we d reach our stop for the night long after everyone else but just before stillness descended upon the valley, Wait for your old man he d sigh struggling to catch his breath We ll get there eventually And yet this ticking time bomb soldiered on The base camp beard and summit gleam from the s had disappeared but the smile stayed put, By week s end now back in France after more than km through the Swiss farmstead villages of La Fouly and Champex I sensed we may have achieved what we both had thought impossible We made our final push towards the Col du Brevent above the Chamonix valley side stepping along a devilishly narrow path then tackled a series of unforeseen rudimentary ladders bolted into the rock my dad enthusiastically swearing with every rung It was an apt final hurdle We climbed up into a narrow world of stone light and echo meeting Mont Blanc face on An ailing Scottish grandpa in good company with the grandfather of the Alps, To capture the moment I took a family portrait but only then did it dawn on me it was nearly the same composition as on a slide I d first seen in one of those junk boxes taken almost years ago There was that smile those eyes fixed on the horizon the beautiful Alpine ridges of Mont Blanc crowding out the background For a split second it looked like nothing had changed, Follow BBC Travel, Explore the BBC]}}
