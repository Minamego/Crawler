queries per second QPS rate This is intended to prevent malicious or out of control software from overwhelming the AdWords API servers and affecting other users, For example if a runaway client accidentally spawned thousands of threads to make concurrent AdWords API calls AdWords API servers will notice and return a requesting the calling software to slow down, It s important to remember that rate limits can fluctuate based on different variables including server load Hence we don t recommend a fixed Queries Per Second QPS limit It s extremely important to understand how to handle and develop your software with rate limits in mind, This guide will dive into more details to help you understand and how to avoid exceeding the rate limit, History, In older AdWords API versions requests made in excess of the limit were queued on the API server until they could run resulting in what seemed like very long execution times for some requests The current API instead of blocking the client for a long time is fail fast and will return a We believe this is an important feedback mechanism that ensures you re aware of the issue and can adjust your applications accordingly, Types of rate limits, We recognize that your AdWords API client application may sometimes exceed the limit and receive a due to factors not fully in your control It s important to note that there is no penalty for doing so is usually transient and automatically resolves after seconds of inactivity, There are a number of different types of rate limits that may be enforced by the server A client application may exceed a rate limit within a manager account s developer token scope or AdWords account scope Within each scope rather than a strict QPS rate limit rate limits are metered in terms of Requests Per Minute Operations Per Minute and or other types of rate limits This allows both steady and burst traffic to the AdWords API Both the scope and the name of the rate limit are returned as part of, Operational limit based on access level, There is only one type of rate limit that doesn t fluctuate the operational limit based on the access level of your developer token There are two access levels and A access level account has limits of operations per day and report downloads per day A newly approved developer token is assigned the access level by default If you plan to execute more than operations or report downloads per day you can apply for access level by completing the There is no charge for either access level Please check out the to determine how operations are counted, Other than the operational limit all other rate limits may fluctuate Thus it s important to handle in your application, Elements of, Let s take a look at in more detail it contains three very important fields, If your application continuously exceeds the rate limit then you ll need to understand and to implement a more permanent throttling strategy in your application, Account scope vs developer scope, The Rate Scope value can be either or This corresponds to whether the Rate Limit was exceeded at an AdWords Account level or at a developer token level, Developer token rate scope, Every AdWords manager account signed up to use AdWords API has a single developer token and every request you make is most likely associated with that developer token If the combined QPS for all client requests using the same developer token exceeds a certain rate limit then may be returned indicating Developer Rate Scope, For example if a manager account manages AdWords accounts and there are multiple client software instances using the same developer token to make a total of hundreds of requests per second across different processes threads or machines then the client software may receive a for the developer token rate scope, Account rate scope, If the same application makes a high number of requests per second on a single AdWords account managed by a manager account the AdWords API Server may return a for exceeding rate limit within the Account scope This could happen for example if your client application spawned multiple threads to perform an excess number of operations against a single AdWords account, Keep in mind that this rate limit across Account rate scope is metered on all requests to a single AdWords account no matter which developer token was used to make the request, Suppose a single AdWords account is managed by five different manager accounts then it s possible that all five manager accounts are making requests against the same AdWords account at the same time If the combined QPS across all manager accounts exceeds the limit then the clients will receive in the Account rate scope, Rate name and why it matters, In addition to understanding rate scope it s also important to understand the type of rate limit that was exceeded The type of the rate limit is returned in the field The commonly seen rate limit names are, Difference between a request and an operation, So what s the difference between and Every SOAP service call is counted as a Request For example every time you call it s counted as one request However within the mutate request you may have passed s this would be counted as operations, In the example above while you may have avoided a rate limit by combining multiple operations into one request you may still hit an rate limit, You can find more examples on how operations are counted on the page, Edge Cases, While the above Rate Names are more common it s important to keep in mind there may be other types of rate limits you can exceed If you experience these issues please let us know in the, Slow down, If your application receives a then it s time to slow down Failing to do so may further delay your application s ability to recover from the error One of the simplest ways to do this is to honor the value when you retry the request and or continue other requests, For example in Java one of the simplest ways to pause your thread before processing another request is to do a, While this approach is simple and straightforward it may be suboptimal for achieving better overall throughput and should be used as the last line of defense, There are a number of ways to mitigate the chances of exceeding the rate limit Becoming familiar with EIP concepts such as Messaging Redelivery and Throttling can help you build a more robust client application, We ll look into those recommended practices in the next section Keep in mind even when mitigation practices are applied it s still important to be able to handle, Take control, You can take control of your application and mitigate as much as possible by both actively reducing the number of requests and throttling QPS from the client side, The following are some recommended practices ordered by complexity with simpler strategies at the top and more robust but sophisticated architectures after, Limit concurrent threads, More often than not the root cause of a is that the client application is spawning an excessive number of threads and all threads are concurrently invoking the AdWords API While we don t limit the number of concurrent threads a client application can have concurrently sending requests via an unlimited number of threads can easily exceed the Requests Per Second limit at the developer token level, It s recommended to set a reasonable upper bound for the total number of concurrent threads that are going to make requests across all processes and machines and adjust upward from there to optimize your throughput without exceeding the rate limit, Furthermore you can consider throttling QPS from the client side across all threads see, Batching requests, Whenever possible consider batching multiple requests into a single request This is most applicable on calls For example if you re updating status for multiple instance of instead of calling once for each you can possibly call once and pass in multiple in one shot Check our for some additional examples as well as, When combining multiple operations into a single request it s important to remember that most requests are atomic If an operation fails then the whole request will fail and nothing will be updated You may change this behavior by taking advantage of the feature, Lastly while batching requests will reduce the number of total requests and mitigate the Requests Per Minute rate limit it may trigger the Operations Per Minute rate limit if you perform a large number of operations against a single account, Use BatchJobService, Consider using the BatchJobService for long running jobs to process a large number of operations or if a large number of operations span across multiple services BatchJobService can schedule and execute thousands of operations for you asynchronously within the Google cloud all you have to do is poll for the result to see if the job has completed, See the for details, Throttling rate limiter, In addition to limiting the total number of threads in your client application you can also implement rate limiters on the client side Such a strategy can ensure all the threads across your processes and or clusters are governed by a specific QPS limit from the client side, You can for example check out or implement your own based algorithm for a clustered environment For example you could generate tokens and store them in a shared transactional storage such as a database and each client would have to acquire and consume a token before it processes the request If the tokens were used up the client would have to wait until the next batch of tokens is generated, In most cases throttling will help you avoid exceeding rate limits in the developer token scope, Interleave requests to different accounts, If you exceed rate limit in the Account scope you can rate limit QPS for the account on the client side but this may be non trivial if you have thousands of accounts to manage A simpler strategy is to interleave requests based on accounts, For example if you re performing operations to accounts one way to do this is to sequentially send batched operations to Account first then Account then Account, While this approach is straightforward you may exceed Rate Limit in Account scope for number of Operations Per Minute, By interleaving the accounts the requests would look like this, While this example illustrates how to interleave requests based on accounts you should also check whether BatchJobService meets your requirements See the for more information, Queueing, A message queue is the best solution for operation load distribution while also controlling request and consumer rates There are a number of message queue options available some open source some proprietary and many of them can work with different languages, When using message queues you can have multiple producers pushing messages to the queue and multiple consumers processing those messages Throttles can be implemented at the consumer side by limiting the number of concurrent consumers or implement rate limiters or throttlers for either the producers or consumers, For example if a message consumer encounters a that consumer can return the request back to the queue to be retried At the same time that consumer can also notify all other consumers to pause processing for a number of seconds to recover from the error, Differentiate queue or rate limiter for new accounts vs established Accounts, When you implement queuing or rate limiter strategies it s important to keep in mind that a new AdWords account may have a significantly more restrictive rate limit i e lower QPS than established accounts Thus if your organization constantly creates new accounts and has a large number of older accounts to manage you should consider using different rate limiters or throttles for the two types of accounts, This way you can maximize your throughput for both types of accounts rather than being limited by the account with the lowest QPS, Typically the more restrictive limits on new AdWords accounts are relaxed once the account has published ads, Except as otherwise noted the

previously visited your website used your mobile app or who are in your CRM databases by showing them relevant ads when they visit other sites or search on Google The user lists used in remarketing can also be used for other types of audience targeting such as, This guide covers, Limitations, Sensitive information about users can t be used to build remarketing lists Before setting up a remarketing campaign and placing the remarketing tag on your website or app please review our, You can target or exclude user lists at both the ad group and campaign levels However positive biddable user lists cannot be set at both levels at the same time Positive user list criteria must be removed from all ad groups within a campaign before one can be set for the campaign, Positive targeting by user list is only supported for Search campaigns For Display campaigns the only option at the campaign level for is to exclude those criteria, User list targets don t support setting the or fields in Search and Shopping campaigns, Audience types in a UserList, You can remarket and target specific audiences with a The list can be constructed from different audience types, This is done through advertiser defined rules A rule can be as simple as including all visitors to your website, This can include actions such as a purchase on your website or app, This is done by combining two or more user lists, People that share similar interests and behaviors with those in other user lists, A user list of uploaded customer emails, Visitors to your website, The simplest type of audience list comprises visitors to your website More advanced targeting strategies described below can for example tailor ads to target only people who recently visited a specific page or combination of pages on your website, All AdWords accounts have exactly one account level remarketing tag created automatically when the account is opened The tag is available even if you haven t yet initiated remarketing The first step is to retrieve your account s account level remarketing tag using, The next step is to install your account level remarketing tag on all of your site s pages Learn more about adding the remarketing tag to your site or mobile app in this, You can also use the in Chrome to validate your tag installation, Next you need to create a user list that contains the people who ve triggered the remarketing tag You create and manage user lists with There are different kinds of user lists with different characteristics To create a list that captures everyone who visited any page on your website you can use an as shown below where the URL of the visited page includes your website s domain See for further details on using rule based remarketing lists, Two important attributes of a user list are and The former allows you to define the time period in days for which a user is considered to be in the list The latter defines whether the list will accept new users, The final step is to target ads to members of your user list The process is similar to other types of targeting criteria in the API The following code demonstrates how you can use a to target ads in an ad group to a user list, As with other types of criteria you can assign other properties to the object such as bid overrides, If you are switching from ad group level user list criteria to campaign level you must first remove the existing user list criteria from each enabled or paused adgroup under that campaign, Existing campaign level user list criteria must also be removed when switching to ad group level user lists and the process mirrors the example shown above Please note that the is not the criterion s underlying user list id, Targeting ads in a campaign to a user list is done similarly, Visitors to specific pages, You can target people who have visited pages or sections of your website using an in a manner similar to the example above but targeted to more specific URLs not just your website s domain See below for an example and more details, Visitors of a page who did visit another page, You can target people who visited more than one page using a The targeting would be done the same way as in the previous example Only the first step changes where you use a rather than an, First create the two rules, Java, C, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Then combine the rules with the, Java, C, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Visitors of a page who did not visit another page, You can target people who visited one page but not another page by using The only change that would have to be made to the previous example is that the rule operator needs to change from to, Visitors who took specific actions, You can populate your audience list with people who have taken specific actions on your website If you re using you can target ads to people who previously triggered a conversion such as a purchase on your website, You can also target ads to people who have taken a particular action on your website that you do consider a conversion such as when a person adds but then deletes an item from their shopping cart without making a purchase Both of these use cases are covered through, Triggered a conversion, If you haven t yet created a conversion tracker you can do so using You can then on your website, A defines its membership as people who had triggered one or more conversion trackers on your website When you create a you provide the value of the field in the you want associated with the user list, The following example creates a associated with two existing conversion trackers, Non conversion actions, You can create a for people who took actions on your website that you do consider conversions by associating it with a with a category of, There are two ways to create such a object The first is by directly using The second is to have it created automatically by AdWords at the same time you create the associated The following code illustrates the second method, Note that a is attached to the list but no is set This triggers the automatic generation of a object of category, You can retrieve the Google global site tag for the automatically generated object, Multiple user lists, You can construct custom combinations of existing user lists as a with fields The rules in the are ANDed so a user must match every rule to be considered in the list However each rule lets you specify whether its operands are ANDed or ORed In other words you can specify whether the user must fulfill ALL of the rule operands or just one of them, In addition rules let you specify other objects as operands effectively letting you create a tree of them can be a very powerful way of defining complex hierarchies of groups for your targeting You can combine lists with different fields However if access is revoked then that will be treated as a list with no members when the rules of the are evaluated, The following code shows how to create a containing users in either of two, Similar audiences, One way of reaching new audiences is using a With this user list you can target people who share characteristics with those in your other user lists, A is automatically generated by Google for each based on a variety of factors for example the number of people on the original list how recently they joined the list the types of sites they browsed and whether the list is yours This process may take up to four days starting from when the source list was created, The following code shows how to find all available objects, Customer match with email address, For advertisers with rich CRM databases you can define and target audience lists based on your CRM data You can upload CRM data in bulk append remove data or use these user lists to create a, These audience lists are eligible to serve on Google Search YouTube and Gmail but will not be available on the Google Display Network, Per policy you will only be allowed to upload data that you have acquired yourself first party You are not allowed to buy email lists from third parties and upload them into the account, For privacy concerns email addresses first names and last names must be hashed using the SHA algorithm before being uploaded In order to standardize the hash results prior to hashing an email address you must, Remove leading trailing whitespaces, Set the email address to be all lowercase, See the section below for a full demonstration of how to add members correctly normalized and hashed, There are different options for Customer Match in different campaign types, Caveats, The API imposes a, The might be different from other user lists, It takes to hours for a list to be populated with members so you ll most likely see an In Progress status on the AdWords UI if you upload to an audience list more frequently than once every hours, Email addresses must be associated with a Google account, Only gmail com addresses can be used for targeting in Gmail, For privacy purposes the user list size will show as zero until the list has at least members After that the size will be rounded to the two most significant digits, Upload at least email addresses to the list to ensure that ads start serving, A can only be combined with another when using a All the policies for will apply to the result user list, Customer match with phone number, Similar to customer match with emails you can also perform customer match with phone numbers, For privacy concerns the phone number needs to be hashed using the SHA algorithm before being uploaded In order to standardize results convert each phone number to before hashing This format represents a phone number as a number up to fifteen digits in length starting with a sign e g, Customer match with mobile device IDs, Similar to customer match with emails you can also perform customer match using IDFA Identifier for Advertising or AAID Google Advertising ID mobile device IDs, Targeting settings for remarketing, Once you ve added a user list to an ad group or campaign as a criterion it s ready to go however it may not be targeting exactly how you d expect To verify that the targeting is working as intended check the on ad groups or campaigns that use the new list by calling their methods, You can set up details on how your various criteria types are used for targeting with an array of objects Each lets you control whether a type of criteria uses the or scheme, When using the criteria won t be used to restrict traffic but will allow you to bid differently for different users on your lists The scheme enables the criteria to restrict ad group traffic only to users on the targeted list, The default targeting for remarketing lists is If you re adding remarketing lists to your main search campaign consider changing the targeting setting to If you re setting up a duplicate campaign for remarketing lists for search ads keep the targeting at, Here s an example that uses the Java client library to set the to on an ad group, The process for setting or on campaigns is nearly identical Use the and methods of a object in the same way as shown for, Performance reports, The exposes the fields needed to collect performance reports of your user lists For example you might look at the or in that report to determine if targeting members of the list is actually leading to more conversions then adjust your bid modifiers accordingly You can also see the user list for each click by including the field in the Consult the for more details, Remarketing with rule based user lists, Rule based user lists allow you to define a targeting audience for your ads based on or Once you have a user list in place and you can target users in the list bid differently for those users and run reports that organize or filter stats based on members of the list, Since this section focuses on rule based lists it contains examples of creating and, Sensitive information about users can t be used to build remarketing lists Before setting up a remarketing campaign and placing the remarketing tag on your website or app please review our page, Using built in remarketing tag parameters, You can use the built in remarketing parameter to target a user list based on the URLs that people have visited on your website For example the code below illustrates how to create a rule based user list for people who visited pages in two different sections of your website Using a built in remarketing parameter does not require making any edits to your remarketing tag, Using custom remarketing tag parameters, You can add to your remarketing tag to create more tailored user lists, Scenario, Let s say you have a site where you ve configured several custom remarketing tag parameters to capture the following attributes of users, You re interested in showing more impressions to users who have placed multiple items in their shopping carts and initiated the checkout process You also want to find users who have made a purchase during November and December because you plan to have a big sale on your site during those months, You can describe this set of users with either of the following rules, If a user falls into either category or category you want to increase your bids in specific ad groups or campaigns by, Objects overview, Before diving into the code let s take a look at the structure of a rule based user list A rule based list is represented in the AdWords API as a The diagram below shows what the for this use case will look like when we re done, Create the first RuleItemGroup, Let s start by creating the first on the left which consists of two s, The first item uses the parameter which has string values so you ll want to create a first, The second item uses the parameter which has numeric values so now you ll need a, Next combine the two into a By default when items are combined into an item group AdWords will their rules together See the for more details, Create the second RuleItemGroup, The on the right consists of two objects, Both of these items use the parameter which has date values so this time you ll create objects, As with the group on the left combine these two objects into a to them together, Create the user list, For there s an additional distinction to make By default AdWords will together all rule items in a rule item group This means that in must match in order for the rule to add a visitor to the list This is called disjunctive normal form or, Alternatively you could set up your list to only add a visitor to the list if in matches This is called conjunctive normal form or and is available for by using the field Trying to use for a will result in an error, All that s left is to combine the rule item groups above into a new user list In this case we ll leave the default functionality in place since that s what we built these rules for, Limit by site visit date range, The above meets your needs but what if you only want to capture the users who satisfy the rule in that list and visit your site between October st and December st Use, To create a follow the same process you d follow for an but also set the and of the list, That s all there is to it The new list will contain all users who meet the same rules as the previous list but only if they visit your site between inclusive and inclusive See the documentation for other options such as open start or end dates, Include past users in the list, You can also include past users in a rule based user list by setting the of the user list to and monitor the progress of the asynchronous prepopulation process by periodically checking the status of this field, Modify bids for users in the list, You ve created a user list and set up the remarketing tag on your site Now you want to specifically target members of the list in your ad groups or campaigns by increasing your bids by, Let s modify the bids for a set of ad groups, The process for modifying bids for a campaign is very similar, Additional user list options, You can take your rule based user lists one step further and combine them with other user lists to create even more sophisticated targeting For example if you have a that targets a specific conversion type and a that targets users based on custom parameters you can target members in both lists by creating a See above for an example, Adding the remarketing tag to your site, For your rule based user lists to be populated you need to If you re using only built in remarketing tag parameters you don t need to make any edits to your remarketing tag If you re using custom parameters see the following article for how to edit your tag to include them, Code examples, Complete code examples for adding a rule based user list are available in the folder of each, Java, C,

Overview, This guide provides an overview of the various ad types and features available in the API from the perspective of a typical use case, Scenario, Let s say you re the proud proprietor of the and you want to launch an advertising campaign to bring in new customers The following sections describe the different ad types and features you could use to achieve this goal, Where do you want your ads to appear, AdWords ads, Let s assume you want to advertise on both networks However you don t want to separately manage a campaign and a campaign so you create a campaign with a single ad group, See the code example in your client library s examples folder for details, Java, C, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, What type of ad do you want, Now that you know your ads will appear it s time to choose the that best meets your requirements The AdWords API offers the following ad types, An on the Search Network will appear only on websites of Google search partners not on Google Search, See the and the for more information including which networks each template ID supports, For this scenario let s assume you start with the most common type of ad an and that you ll use the same to advertise on both the Search and Display networks, Expanded text ad setup, An is a relatively simple object you just need to specify the, Check out the example in your client library s examples folder for a complete example, Java, C, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Gmail ad setup, A can only be created in a campaign that has the set to and the set to There are a few things to keep in mind while creating a, Check out the example in your client library s examples folder for a complete example, Java, C, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Adding ad extensions, You can start with a basic in your ad group but you may have noticed other ads on the Search and Display networks that contain additional information links and action buttons, This additional information comes from Most ad extensions are managed via feed services in the AdWords API Using ad extensions you can improve your ads with, Adding sitelink extensions, As the owner of the you want people to know that the shop, This information is a great fit for, To set up sitelink extensions see the instructions in the guide which includes a link to a complete code example for each client library, Adding location extensions, Your ad is up and showing links to various areas of your site but you want users to find your store s location easily especially if they re viewing your ad on a mobile device, If you already entered this information in your account then you re in luck all you need to do is link your Google My Business account to your AdWords accounts and AdWords will display the location in your ads, See the guide for step by step instructions and code examples, More ad extensions, Now that you ve set up sitelinks and location extensions for your campaign adding other extensions such as app callout or review extensions is very similar The only difference is the type of used with the extension setting services, The guide includes examples for each extension type, Ad rotation, If you have multiple ads within an ad group your ads will rotate because no more than one ad from your account can show at a time You can use to specify how often you d like the ads in your ad group to be served relative to one another, There are two settings for ad rotation, Ad rotation settings are specified at the ad group level using the ad group s property You can remove the ad rotation setting by passing an with the set to, Ad scheduling, Like many things in life advertising is all about timing A lot of businesses have special advertising needs during certain times of day and they want to target customers at specific times Incorporating ad scheduling in your campaigns causes your ads to display at the time they re most useful resulting in more focused targeting and higher returns, allows you to decide programmatically when to run your ads without requiring you to manually enable and disable them, Scheduling works at the campaign level so it applies to all active ad groups and ads inside it This is handled by and one of its criterion types, Each criterion allows you to define a number of properties such as day of week start and end times and a formerly handled through the of the CampaignTargetService With bid modifiers you can increase or decrease your bids at specified times, Keep these two options in mind when checking if a campaign is configured to run at all times, To modify an ad schedule you submit deltas that add or remove hours days rather than a whole new set of times as you may have done in the past, Code examples, To make sure the ads run mostly during opening hours set the start time for the ads to a bit before opening and the end time a bit before closing, Java, CSharp, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, VB NET, To give customers fair warning about a special lunchtime deal on Mondays start advertising early in the morning and increase significantly during the promotion hours, Java, CSharp, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, VB NET, To stop ads from showing during specific times remove the criteria using its and the campaign s, Java, CSharp, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, VB NET, This example shows how to change the time ads are showing You need to remove the existing first then add the new one, Java, CSharp, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, VB NET, Check out these code examples to see how to use the to add a target to an existing campaign, Java, C, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Measuring ad performance, You ve set up a campaign an ad group a text ad and multiple ad extensions Now you want to find out how your campaign ads and extensions are performing This is where comes in, You can look at your campaign s performance from different perspectives to answer key questions Expand each use case below to see relevant and a sample report request, How is my campaign performing on vs, Which ads result in the most clicks, Which ad extensions are users clicking, Which sitelinks are users clicking, Which ads are getting the most clicks from mobile users, Which sites have shown my ads and how many clicks did they generate, The questions above focus on some common use cases and features For even more options check out the, Next steps, After analyzing your reports you may want to, Except as otherwise noted

including estimated stats like, You can simulate and by using different campaign criteria network settings daily budgets and max CPCs, You can also retrieve traffic estimates for an existing campaign or ad group by providing the corresponding and, Use case, When creating a new campaign and ad group or when modifying existing campaigns you can use the TrafficEstimatorService to estimate future traffic and help you decide whether your proposed keywords and settings are optimal For example if the chosen keywords result in a lower CTR you may want to reconsider using the keyword, You can also use the TrafficEstimatorService to obtain information similar to the feature of the, Additionally you can use the to get additional keyword ideas for an ad group Before implementing the new keyword ideas use the TrafficEstimatorService to get an estimate on how these new keywords will perform Check out for additional information, Getting traffic estimates, The primary input to the TrafficEstimatorService is the, To retrieve traffic estimates you must either specify existing campaigns and ad groups or configure proposed campaigns and ad groups by setting the and, Within you must also specify a for the keywords you want traffic estimates for, The following sections step through an example of getting traffic estimates from the TrafficEstimatorService, Prepare the request, You ll need to build the from the bottom up To create a full request you should build the request in the following order, First you need to build the It s common to retrieve estimates for multiple keywords Each keyword should have a corresponding, Java, C, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, The list of keywords you send to TrafficEstimatorService can contain what you already have in your keyword taxonomy or it can contain new keywords you retrieve from the, Next build the Like the keywords list you can estimate on multiple ad groups This example estimates only for a single ad group, Java, C, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Next build the To get more accurate results you should also set additional campaign criteria when building the such as location and language You can also specify existing campaign IDs and ad group IDs in the and which allows the service to load historical data, Java, C, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Finally configure the You can then send it through the operation to retrieve the traffic estimates encapsulated in the object You can request a list of campaign level estimates segmented by platform using the property, Java, C, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Process the response, Each object in the selector generates a corresponding object in the Similarly each object will have a corresponding object in the result If you requested campaign level estimates segmented by platform they ll be available through the property of the object, Java, C, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, The most important and interesting result object is the corresponding object within the It contains the lower bound and upper bound of the traffic estimation for each keyword, Bear in mind that the returned values are estimates and are not a guarantee that actual performance will be within these bounds, Calculating estimated total conversion value, The API doesn t directly provide an estimated total conversion value like the Keyword Planner but you can calculate one from the stats provided, Mapping to the Keyword Planner, You can use the TrafficEstimatorService like you use in the AdWords Keyword Planner, To use the TrafficEstimatorService for this you need to specify either a pre existing campaign or create a mock campaign complete with ad groups and keywords, In the Keyword Planner you can specify a daily budget and a bid amount In the AdWords API a is part of the and the bid amount called can be set either in the or the These must be specified at request time so even though they re on the screen of the Keyword Planner they must be included as part of the request when using the API, Complete
