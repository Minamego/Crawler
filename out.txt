some of the big events in the coming year Some picks are expected some surprising and sometimes even our fearless prognosticators admit they have no idea what to pick, Predictions for, In February the world will be watching the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang South Korea And in November the US election will determine if Republicans can retain control of Congress Our prognosticators weigh in on those events while also making predictions for annual contests including the Grammys Super Bowl and Oscars, , Which film will win the Oscar for best picture in, The Shape of Water won four Academy Awards, Best picture will be won by a small independent production Mudbound It is a wonderful moving film about racism and the struggle of farm life in post WWII Mississippi It will give the Academy the ability to honor some great African American actors and the film s talented director Dee Rees The rest of the cast is fabulous as well As the film industry moves in the direction of initial releases on Netflix this would also be the Academy s prescient nod in the direction of the film industry s future, I desperately want Wonder Woman to win in but I don t want to jinx its chances so I say Lady Bird It s a coming of age movie that feels so real and it s a girl power film The Oscars will be all about women women women And it is about time, As a military history buff and huge fan of period pieces I am going with Hostiles I ve been told it might be the best Western since s Unforgiven And it has Christian Bale, The Post a movie that highlights the power of courage the importance of the press in holding the powerful accountable and the indispensable role of a woman pushing against obstacles that remain unseen to far too many people the perfect message for our times, It has to be Get Out by director Jordan Peele Compelling story line twists and turns and the issue of race A tad scary very entertaining and not predictable It s a lock, The Post Hollywood won t miss a chance to send a message about journalism and accomplished women to the Trump White House Logan or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol would get my vote, Oscar will go fun with Get Out I d love to see it be a Marvel adventure like Logan but sadly the critics don t see my favorite Sci Fi and comic flicks as fine art Get Out is by talented new director Jordan Peele Sure it s a long shot but at least the racially relevant horror film is fun And after we could all use a few laughs, Mudbound a lyrically moving and spellbindingly beautiful look at race relations during the Second World War should win the Oscar but probably won t Instead it will likely be The Post set at a time when The Washington Post held the power to take down an administration A perfect story for the world we live in now, I m going with the Big Sick Not only a great movie but it was written by and starred a Muslim immigrant Kumail Nanjiani which will upset Donald Trump and Steve Bannon even more, My heart is with Wonder Woman but my head is with Dunkirk, The Post It features bravura performances from Meryl Street and Tom Hanks and the story of the Pentagon Papers holds incredible relevance for our current political climate This Oscar will be Hollywood s latest rebuke to Trump, Blade Runner The most European film made in Hollywood I ve ever seen, I love war movies and Dunkirk is the best I ve seen in a long time The story is compelling and the photography is out of this world, In the best of all possible worlds it would be a film that represents Hollywood s ability to deliver truth and beauty even as the lies and ugliness that bubbles beneath its glittering surface continues to seep out My money would be on Jordan Peele s searingly brilliant Get Out But if that or Dee Rees s riveting Mudbound or Greta Gerwig s funny deft and moving Lady Bird don t get a nod then I throw my hands up at an industry that seems committed to clinging to the past and refusing to acknowledge the urgency of the present and future, Jump

will say health care costs will rise in And the national debt will balloon more than a trillion dollars Those two things make me very uncomfortable, The Dow will fluctuate as a sine wave as is its wont to do But it will settle by year s end to Consumer confidence soars Tax cuts kick in Obama era overregulation is reined in And the president will step on the good news with a poorly timed tweet, The Dow Jones will continue climbing through most of before nosediving during or after the summer prompting President Trump who has taken credit for the gains to find someone else to blame for the drop, Enuf said, Wildcard If Democrats win total control of Congress the market crashes in November, Biggest observation for no matter how much chaos in the world the Dow is like Teflon But in our national reality will catch up with the Dow and the record setting growth will readjust and fall to, I d say around in light of tax bill passing, If Trump remains as President I d say around If Trump resigns it could skyrocket to, Just under based on renewed confidence after a shift in leadership but there will be some dips during the year, Around thanks to Republican lawmakers penchant for cutting what they see as needless regulations and their tax reform bill which is a gift to corporations and high earners, Strongly Trump s tax cuts should send things sky high Can it hit I wouldn t like to say but expect a giant sucking sound as capital shifts from Europe to the USA, I expect confidence in the economy will continue to grow as we see tax reform taking shape By the end of the year I predict the DJIA will be at, Honestly I m just hoping we re all still around at the end of, Jump to start of or, , What will be the Grammys Album of the Year, Bruno Mars including Album of the Year for K Magic, Best album will be Jay Z s He and Beyonc need the extra publicity to generate increased album sales now that Blue Ivy has been joined by twin siblings Sir and Rumi After all college expenses for three kids are through the roof these days, Kendrick Lamar for DAMN Incendiary and the critics cannot stop talking about it I can t either, Kendrick Lamar s DAMN I m old enough to remember rap s first categorical recognition by the Academy in I think Lamar runs away with the award at a time when musicians and athletes are increasingly using their platforms to influence our nation s social conscience, It should be Lorde s Melodrama but it won t be The most newsworthy pick would be Childish Gambino aka Donald Glover for his album Awaken My Love He already won an Emmy for his FX series Atlanta But it will not be enough to keep Kendrick Lamar s DAMN from being named Album of the Year, Jay Z s as a salute to the Message and Messenger, Jay Z with he s on a PR offensive and clearly wants it, Jay Z s Few have told the story of the black experience in America for my generation better than Jay Z And his th album is a masterpiece hands down the best album of Growing up the poetry and power of hip hop music and culture helped to shape me into the confident conscious often contrary Gen X woman I am today, Album of the year A tie between Jay Z and Kendrick Lamar two monumental talents at the top of their games in turning their respective personal and political travails into popular artistry that can attract millions in an age of painfully curated musical tastes, Jay Z s, Lorde s Melodrama, DAMN by Kendrick Lamar This album has already made many Top Ten best album lists It s personal and political sacred and secular and mixes old school rap with radio friendly numbers a winning formula, Music died in about so I have no idea, Bruno Mars had me at hello when I saw him do Carpool Karaoke with James Corden All my gold is on Bruno winning a Grammy for k Magic, I kind of need this to be anybody but Lorde, Jump to start of or, , Who will win the World Series, The Yankees will win the World Series given the new additions to the roster and the Yanks fine finish with a green roster in, I hate hate hate saying this but the New York Yankees, There s a reason I m not a gambler I ll always bet with my heart So of course it s my hometown Atlanta Braves who forever it seems remain in a rebuilding status, The Cleveland Indians will snatch victory in a dramatic series against the LA Dodgers who will continue perfecting the art of finishing second, Ball game over Yaaaaaankees win THE YAAAAANKEES WIN Giancarlo and Judge carry them to victory with their big bats, Hard to bet against the New York Yankees You gotta spend money to make money and they did building a new Murderer s Row in Stanton Judge Gregorious and Sanchez Those guys may hit HR s among them But the Astros Dodgers Indians Nats Cubs and Cards will give the Yanks a run for their money, I m going with the LA Dodgers to win the World Series Yes I remember Game this year when the Houston Astros crushed the Dodgers But back to back wins are nearly impossible in the Wild Card crazed baseball today unless of course you are talking about my beloved Yankees, The New York Yankees A hitting line up that includes Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton could be the most fearsome since Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris combined for home runs in, The NY Mets at least in my head, The Cubs They had a down year but still have a great team, I have hometown bias but The Los Angeles Dodgers will go all the way We almost made it this year and hope springs eternal GO BLUE, The Washington Nationals I hope, I am a lifelong Atlanta Braves and Hank Aaron fan and always will be However the MLB Commissioner s ruling that the Braves have to forfeit more than a dozen international prospects will hurt the team in So I have faith that the Washington Nationals will go all the way in, As a Yankees fan since the days of the Evil Empire I for one welcome our new First Order overlords, Jump to start of or, , What will Trump s approval rating be at the end of, It s probably going to stay in the low s as that seems to be the low water mark of his rock solid base Around is where he will be if he is still in office There is a strong possibility that his reliance on the three food groups of Big Macs Kentucky Fried Chicken and diet Cokes a day as well as the stress of office may compel his family to talk him into resigning the presidency and moving into the family s new real estate venture Trump branded assisted living facilities with Twitter enabled computers and high speed internet connections, Nothing can change Trump s behavior And nothing can change his core supporters opinion of his MAGA genius He will remain tethered to a approval rating, Well safer bet to say it has to be higher than it is right now I think an economy that continues to gain momentum fewer Twitter attacks on private citizens and meaningful progress against the Islamic State will see him reach approval, Trump s hardest of hardcore supporters will stand by him no matter what and if there s US military action expect a rally round the flag effect But eventually his approval will erode and he will end the year at, Assuming Trump hasn t resigned by June with a dismal approval rating of his approval rating bounces back to an almost as dismal, Among all adults Registered and likely voter samples will be to points higher He ll take a beating in the Fall when nearly all Democratic midterm campaign advertising trashes him Wildcards Mueller North Korea, Trump has seen the lowest approval ratings of any sitting president right now hovering around according to FiveThirtyEight com If Trump can hold on to his office and survive Russia gate and multiple sexual harassment accusations expect his approval rating to hover around, It should remain steady in the thirty percent range reflecting a hardcore base whose loyalty remains unyielding A new Democrat controled Congress may in fact help the President s approval rating after the midterm elections, Assuming Trump is still president I predict his approval rating will be down to the area of just friends and family Or at most will hit, Below, His approval rating is currently at a record low of according to Monmouth University polling and will stay in this same range for the foreseeable future Trump s core base will stick with him no matter what, ish His position is stuck as he has said himself he could shoot someone and it wouldn t sink lower He could raise them from the dead and it wouldn t go up, President Trump and the GOP scored a major victory with passage of the Tax Reform legislation If the President can keep his Twitter comments on message and the economy is strong I can see the president s approval rising into the low s, Honestly I m just hoping he s not still in office at the end of I m going to say it will round down to zero, Jump to start of or, , Who will win the Super Bowl, The to earn the team s first Lombardi Trophy, The Saints will win this year this year and President Trump will claim the win was due to the players decision to kneel in protest before the National Anthem but to stand during the anthem itself Making Football Great Again, The Detroit Lions I wish Oh I ache for that But after suffering through seasons of agonizing disappointment I have to pick the Patriots Oh god I hate the Patriots So my final pick is The New Orleans Saints, Again I bet with my heart As a long suffering Atlanta Falcons fan who survived in last year s Super Bowl meltdown against the Patriots hope springs eternal Atlanta Falcons And shame on all of you for snickering I see you, The New England Patriots will walk away with the Super Bowl once again in but their victory in frigid Minneapolis this February will come with much less drama than their win against Atlanta in, Although earning an A is always the best bet it s all about the B s in Pittsburgh Too much Ben Brown and Bell The Steelers win the Super Bowl and steal the show, Like a lot of Republicans I haven t watched one second of the NFL this year so I ll say the Los Angeles Rams because my friend advised me to make a bold prediction Ratings will be down maybe more than A lot of people will tune in to see who kneels for the National Anthem and then switch to Netflix to binge watch the Cohen Brothers The Ballad of Buster Scruggs if it comes out in time, Big Ben and the Steelers What a messy year for the NFL Silent protests noisy counter protests It was hard to be a football fan even if as I do you support the right of the players to protest issues of police brutality My Philadelphia Eagles are all banged up so I ll have to go with the Pittsburgh Steelers to take the Lombardi trophy, The New Orleans Saints defeat the New England Patriots in an upset, Since New York doesn t have a professional football team with a chance this year I m going with the Philadelphia Eagles But in any event I m hoping it s anyone but the Patriots or Cowboys, The Patriots, I am going with the Patriots over the Rams only because they have so much Super Bowl experience and of course Tom Brady, The Patriots, I am a newfound Philadelphia Eagles fan and have come to admire the fans love of the team and distain for the refs Even without Carson Wentz I am cheering for the Eagles to win the Super Bowl, Is this the thing with the puppies I m going to say the Giants hahahaha no Probably the Patriots because life is unfair, Jump to start of or, , Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize, Pope Francis for efforts at peacemaking around the world, Donal oh no This is tough The only world leader I can think of is Angela Merkel Girl stood strong in the face of the haters And continues to do so, The award is split with a historic d tente established between the Republic of Korea and North Korea following warming relations that began to thaw during the Winter Olympics This might be wishful thinking but President Moon Jae in and the Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, As the tide of authoritarianism continues to wash away the foundations of democracy the Nobel committee will look for a champion of liberal democratic principles in an established democracy Nobel will surprise with a joint prize to the Washington Post and New York Times, Angela Merkel, Whichever American pilot is judged the hero of the mega battle to defeat the alien invasion our government is apparently tracking Could also be the metoo campaign or maybe Anderson Cooper for demanding that commentators stop interrupting each other during AC political panels, My prediction for the Nobel Peace Prize is Women Every woman who stood up told her story and worked toward systemic and cultural changes in the way our nation and the world discusses and defines sexual harassment and violence against women and girls Special recognition should go to Anita Hill for the courage and grace with which she opened the conversation for workingwomen years ago and Tarana Burke the founder of the MeToo movement in long before the Hollywood spotlight took notice Brava, Bryan Stevenson the founder of the Equal Justice Institute author of Just Mercy and the nation s foremost advocate of transforming the criminal justice system so that those who are rich and guilt no longer enjoy better treatment that those who are poor and innocent, Can I nominate Steve Bannon He has amazingly been able to bring together Democrats and Republicans to put aside their differences to unite in their hate of him If not then I d nominate organizations that are helping refugees in war torn areas of Syria Yemen and Myanmar, Pope Francis There doesn t appear to be a clear candidate for resolving the North Korean crisis given the troubling trajectory this past year, It could well go to The Washington Post for its excellent reporting on the Trump campaign and administration Their journalism has been an outstanding reminder of the need for a vital free press My choice would be San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz who has been tirelessly working to raise awareness of the dire situation in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, Steve Bannon The whole thing is becoming silly Perhaps he can bring peace to between the Republicans and the Democrats someone to unite against, The Nobel Committee has a warm spot for global warming I predict former Kiribati President Anote Tong will win the Nobel Peace Prize due to his strong leadership on climate change, Other than Time Man Person of the Year the Nobel Peace Prize is the world s most consistently irrelevant honor so frankly I have neither interest nor an opinion, Jump to start of or, , Which party will win the most seats in the House of Representatives in the midterms, The Democrats, Democrats will win big But come up short as always, Enthusiasm generated by a soaring economy will allow many voters to forgive the president s shortcomings The Resistance will peel off a few seats but the GOP maintains control of the House by only a slightly slimmer margin, The GOP The Democratic Party will make significant gains but not enough to take the majority, Here I ll make an extra prediction going beyond the call of duty The Dems take the House AND the Senate Get ready for divided government until when the Dems also take the White House, Riding a good economy and unhinged Democratic messaging Republicans manage to surf the blue wave and hold on by a nose, Republicans will hold on to the House Despite theories about President Trump s low approval ratings hurting his party it s hard to fight the numbers or redistricting in key states, The Democratic Party buoyed by social movements advocating women s equality the fundamental value of black life immigrant rights and LGBQT communities will win back control of both houses of Congress, America s party The Democrats, The Democrats The last two special elections in Virginia and Alabama have shown that the base is energized Over the next year Dems need to show they are not just the party of resistance but the party of rebuilding with candidates who fit their districts and are still aligned with the core of that party, The Democrats no contest As we ve seen so far in Virginia New Jersey and Alabama there is a blue wave of resistance gathering strength across the country and it will be cresting in November, The Democrats Their performance in Virginia and Alabama shows the way low turnout liberals registering discontent minorities energized Trump in trouble, I m confident the tax reform legislation will boost the economy and the finances of middle income Americans And as James Carville said it s the economy stupid Therefore Republicans will reap the rewards of tax reform in the midterms, praying hands emoji The Democrats, Jump to start of or, , Which country will win the most medals at the Winter Olympics, Norway earned the most hardware at

athletic Norway followed by the United States Canada and South Korea Independent Russian athletes competing without a flag will take home a few medals to a disconsolate nation, U S A U S A U S A, Germany Enough Russians will compete under the Olympic flag to offset Norway, No way I ll ever cheer for another nation to beat the US at the Olympics I m a proud protesting American Even if the Russians hadn t been banned for state backed doping my money is still on America Red White and Blue baby, The United States, Unless you are a Russian hacker sent to help Trump win an election you must surely admit it s going to be the United States of America USA USA USA, With Russia out because of the doping scandal I put my money with a dose of patriotic pride on the United States and Norway in a close second, I am going with Norway which is traditionally dominant during the winter games and also because U N Ambassador Nikki Haley has suggested the US might not compete over security concerns, Great Britain, While my Olympic dreams were cut short due to my lack of speed and talent I live vicariously through Team USA every Olympic year I expect Team USA to capture the most medals in I will

Four between them, Every single one they enter, I m just counting Women s Singles titles and will give new mom Serena a break and give hope to Venus for claiming a women s singles title in That would

the Vatican and Belgium, Trump will travel to the one country on Earth that will warmly welcome the new US President while Americans cheer as well Israel He is respected there for his pro Israel and anti Iranian foreign policy positions Daughter Ivanka s conversion to the Jewish faith won t hurt either, Traditionally the first state visit is to Canada but how likely is Donald Trump to feel bound to tradition He s already been to Mexico and met with President Enrique Pe a Nieto a country everyone believed he d long ago alienated So although it sounds unbelievable maybe the Philippines, Israel It s our staunchest ally and friend in the Middle East a region that Trump will likely place significant focus on as he begins his presidency, The layup is of course to say Russia right But I m betting it s Israel or the UK, Donald Trump likes to make brazen unpredictable moves A visit to China would fit the bill He has been needling Beijing with provocative statements that undercut decades of US policy In Beijing he could present his demands to the Chinese and discuss what he expects them to do about the growing threat from China s friend North Korea s Kim Jong Un, Israel Trump will visit and stage photo ops with like minded hardliners against a Palestinian state in effort to rally the right and legitimize his pick of far right David Friedman as Israeli ambassador, President Trump s first visit abroad will be to Russia where he will meet with Vladimir Putin a leader he repeatedly expressed admiration for during the election as the first step toward easing economic sanctions, Russia to thank Vladimir Putin for his help winning the election, The Philippines to see the controversial Rodrigo Duterte This would bolster American influence in the Pacific and the Philippines is home to Manila s Trump Tower, Russia is likely the first stop particularly with Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, Mexico or Israel, Great Britain Trump is half British he has businesses in the UK and he loves Brexit It s one country that wouldn t riot if he showed up, Depends on where he wants to build his next hotel, Jump to start of or, , Which team will win the Super

them, I m required to say the Green Bay Packers But the Patriots will greedily win it again Because it s been nearly a year, The New England Patriots Still don t bet on politics staying out of the game or out of Lady Gaga s halftime show a reminder that political tensions will be hard to escape in, The Pittsburgh Steelers I m a Philly girl My Eagles fell off but I ll stick with the home state I m rolling with Le Veon Bell the best running back in the game, The New York Giants go on another magical run defeating the New England Patriots and beating them for the third time in nine years to win the big game, Being a diehard New York Giants fan I m predicting the Giants win it all But if they don t I will be rooting for any time playing against the dreaded New England Patriots, The Dallas Cowboys Their defense is on an upswing their offense is consistently great and Dak Prescott is unstoppable, New England Patriots Deflategate is in the rearview mirror and Brady is in his prime The only question is whether their defense can win it, Kansas City Chiefs, No idea, In a showdown that sums up the jingoist masculine defensive spirit of these Trumpian times the Patriots and Cowboys will

that are just about to come out so it s hard to say But I will lose my ISH if it s a Star Wars product, The winner will be Lion an astonishing story of survival with elements that can provide a sense of pride and optimism to people of different ethnicities and economic conditions, Fences Only the mega talented Denzel Washington could take August Wilson s theater masterpiece and turn it into a big screen blockbuster Washington along with co star Viola Davis make this a winner, The Oscar will go to Moonlight a searing examination of a young gay black boy s coming of age under extraordinarily challenging circumstances in Florida A film that humanizes experiences often reduced to stereotypes or flat out ignored, Rogue One A Star Wars Story Sure it s a longshot but then again so was Trump,

little does the childish conception of being dead resemble our own, Sigmund Freud, People don t know what to make of him he doesn t know what to make of himself he s only not astonishingly bright but there are antennae he has some sort of receivers in his head things speak to him he understands more than he should the world winks at him through its objects grabs grinning at his coat Everybody else is in on some secret he doesn t know they ve forgotten to tell him, John Barth, One of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty one and even is the conviction that nothing like this all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding has ever happened to anyone before, Joan Didion, years old biological clock buzzing like crazy and it looked like my last chance for you know for real happiness, Tim O Brien, According to my dermatologist the neck starts to go at and that s that short of surgery there s not a damn thing you can do about a neck Our faces are lies and our necks are the truth, Nora Ephron, was too old for dreams of the future At fifty one you had to keep running just to escape the avalanche of your own past, Stephen King, Fame success power million dollars world leadership well if they should arrive I might not exactly take to cover but as for lying awake nights craving them as in my youth I did well I really don t care to any more, Theodore Dreiser, You must take living so seriously That even at for example you ll plant olive trees And not for your children either But because although you fear death you don t believe it Because living I mean weighs heavier, N z m Hikmet, The old Marquis de la Tour Samuel who was rose and leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece said in his somewhat shaky voice I am afraid of the dark But I would not have acknowledged that before I reached my present age Now I can say anything, Guy de Maupassant, At the age of no bond is any longer possible all is merely juxtaposition a newcomer is in the way There is no longer any room all

currently reading varies widely meaning that we too have in the past wondered where the boundaries for the various generations were drawn Is a year old who gets text message condolences from her friends a Millennial by virtue of her behavior Or is she some other generation because she was born super long ago Sorry year old Rebecca Soffer who is a friend of a friend of mine and who I met once You re not actually that old Since is committed to Broadening Human Understanding I decided to find out where generational boundaries are drawn, I started by calling the Census Bureau A representative called me back without much information We do not define the different generations she told me The only generation we do define is Baby Boomers and that year bracket is from to, Next I spoke with Tom DiPrete a sociology professor at Columbia University And he agreed with the Census Bureau I think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media DiPrete said and the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation It had specific characteristics and occurred within an observable timeframe World War II ended You had the post war rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family Then societal changes disrupted those patterns and the generation for academic purposes was over His main point History isn t always so punctuated, I understood why Generation X a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty would be poorly defined But what about Millennials Doesn t their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers I actually haven t seen efforts to document generations rigorously and I would be somewhat skeptical that they be documented rigorously DiPrete said The things that have shaped Millennials the rise of technology and social networks for example affect people s lives differently, The media in particular wants definitions identities DiPrete said I don t know that the definitions are as strong or as widely shared across all the boundaries At the end I think it gets fuzzy, Well yeah We want definitions And if it s the media that draws the boundaries then allow us to do so definitively, Your official demarcation of generational boundaries, We identified six different generations and labeled their eras, These are the people that fought and died in World War II for our freedom which we appreciate But it s a little over the top as far as names go isn t it Tom Brokaw made the name up and everyone loved it What you re going to argue with your grandfather that he in the greatest generation The generation ended when the war ended, This is the agreed upon generation that falls within DiPrete s punctuated timeframe It began when the Greatest Generation got home and started having sex with everyone it ended when having sex with everyone was made easier with The Pill, George Masnick of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies this generation in the timeframe of to in part because it s a neat year period He also calls it the baby bust mocking p undits on Madison Avenue and in the media that call it Generation X Ha ha tough luck, Masnick addresses this group too putting it anywhere from the mid s when the oldest were born to the mid s when the youngest were But mostly Generation Y is a made up generation when it became obvious that young kids didn t really fit with the cool Generation X aesthetic but not enough of them had been born to make a new generation designation Generation Y is a fake made up thing Do not worry about it, In October researchers Neil Howe and William Strauss Millennials the next great generation which is funny They define the group as as those born in and approximately the years thereafter In they affixed the end point, But that means that kids born in the last years lack a designation They Millennials Earlier this month Pew Research what the group should be called and offered some terrible ideas In other words this is the new Generation Y We ll figure out what they re called in the future, Here we made a helpful chart, There you have it The experts say the media get to determine when generations happen and we re the media We also get to say which generations are the worst and the Millennials are the worst But you already knew that, Couples Speak Honestly About Open Relationships, Non monogamous couples speak candidly about the challenges and rewards of their unconventional lifestyle, About the Author, Most Popular, Donald Trump Doesn t Understand Community Colleges, In a speech on Thursday he revealed he doesn t appreciate the vital role they play in the country s education system and economy, During a speech on Thursday President Trump revealed a striking ignorance of one of the pillars of his country s educational system In the course of promoting his infrastructure plan he a bit perplexingly dismissed the country s community colleges suggesting he doesn t know what purpose they serve We do not know what a community college means he told the crowd in an Ohio training facility for construction apprentices moments after expressing nostalgia for the vocational schools that flourished when he was growing up schools that offered hands on training in fields such as welding and cosmetology, He seemed to have a better grasp on these latter schools analogizing them to the apprenticeship programs he was promoting in his effort to create high paying infrastructure jobs The implication as he brushed aside one form of higher education and lauded another was that he d like to resuscitate short term training opportunities and phase out community colleges in the name of workforce development, The Case Against High School Sports, The United States routinely spends more tax dollars per high school athlete than per high school math student unlike most countries worldwide And we wonder why we lag in international education rankings, thousands of teenagersmove to the United States from all over the world for all kinds of reasons They observe everything in their new country with fresh eyes including basic features of American life that most of us never stop to consider, One element of our education system consistently surprises them Sports are a big deal here says Jenny who moved to America from South Korea with her family in Shawnee High her public school in southern New Jersey fields teams in sports over the course of the school year including golf and bowling Its campus has lush grass fields six tennis courts and an athletic Hall of Fame They have days when teams dress up in Hawaiian clothes or pajamas just because We re the soccer team Jenny says To protect the privacy of Jenny and other students in this story only their first names are used, Immigrants Give America a Foreign Policy Advantage, History proves they can help the U S keep other countries in check, It has often been thought that the composition of the American public consisting as it does of immigrants from so many lands is a vulnerability in foreign policy that for example German immigrants would harbor affinities for their land of origin and become disloyal during the world wars The argument was taken to a shameful extreme with the internment of Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor What has received less attention is the extent to which America s immigrant fabric can be a foreign policy advantage even a threat to other countries That is what British Prime Minister Palmerston feared and what President Lincoln stoked to forestall British recognition of the Confederacy during the Civil War The result was an important inhibition on Great Britain then the most powerful state of the international order, America s Moral Malady, The nation s problem isn t that we don t have enough money It s that we don t have the moral capacity to face what ails society, I Martin Luther King Jr visited homes in the hamlet of Marks Mississippi Later he remembered the hundreds of children who lacked shoes A mother told King that her children had no clothes for school The Nobel laureate wept openly They didn t even have any blankets to cover their children up on a cold night he recalled And I said to myself Then he vowed We are going to say in no uncertain terms that we aren t going to accept it any longer We ve got to go to Washington in big numbers, Why Is Trump Turning Against Russia Now, The president s lingering insecurity about his legitimacy might explain his willingness to punish the Kremlin for a poisoning in London but not for meddling in the election, No single stand has hobbled Donald Trump s presidency more than his attitude toward Russia, During the presidential campaign he conspicuously praised Vladimir Putin and refused to condemn his seizure of Crimea Trump also publicly called for Russia to release emails hacked from Hillary Clinton something his aides said was a joke Trump s perceived softness on Putin seems to have encouraged advisers like George Papadopoulos and perhaps Michael Flynn to make overtures to the Kremlin whether Trump intended that or not, Once in office Trump s apparent Russophilia has continued to dog him and his eagerness to stifle or shut down any investigation that touched on it has directly or indirectly produced tremendous legal and political peril for Trump Polls show support for Special Counel Robert Mueller concern that Trump obstructed justice and worries that the president doesn t take Russia seriously enough Russia is hardly the only problem the president has but it is the largest and most multifarious No matter what Trump does for the rest of his term he will be unable to undo the damage of his strange stance toward Russia so far, The Diet That Might Cure Depression, Several studies show that healthy eating is connected with better mood, At the turn of the th century prominent physicians who were trying to understand where mental illness comes from seized on a new theory autointoxication Intestinal microbes these doctors suggested are actually dangerous to their human hosts They fatigue melancholia and the neuroses as a historical article in the journal recounts, The control of man s diet is readily accomplished but mastery over his intestinal bacterial flora is not a doctor named Bond Stow in the in The innumerable examples of autointoxication that one sees in his daily walks in life is proof thereof malaise total lack of ambition so that every effort in life is a burden mental depression often bordering upon melancholia, Chicago s Awful Divide, Americans are flocking to big cities to find good jobs opportunities that remain disproportionately out of reach for the poorest residents already living there, CHICAGO Americans hear a lot these days about the country s urban rural divide Rural counties are poorer urban ones richer Rural areas are losing jobs urban ones are gaining them People with a college education are leaving rural areas They re moving to urban places, Behind this divergence lies a straightforward story The twin forces of globalization and technological change are a handful of big urban areas while resources are drained from the heartland leaving it often devoid of opportunity and prosperity But this neat division rural versus urban erases another part of the story of America s changing economy the pressure that those twin forces are exerting within cities pulling some people up to the very top while pushing others to an unforgiving bottom In some prosperous cities such as Chicago where the number of has grown fourfold since people at the bottom are struggling as much as they always have if not more illustrating that it s not just the white rural poor who are being left behind in today s economy The disconnect is why Andrew Diamond the author of has called Chicago a combination of Manhattan smashed against Detroit, Mormons Weekly Family Ritual Is an Antidote to Fast Paced Living, Family home evening regular time set aside for praying and playing has taken on new relevance a century after it was conceived, Every Monday evening Mormons around the world pause as families Together they pray sing play games eat snacks This is all standard fare for many American households but the difference is that for Mormons it s built into every Monday night or sometimes another night and it has an official deceptively generic sounding name family home evening, The weekly gathering is far more than a family game night Vern Bengtson a sociologist who ran a major study of at home religious practices that spanned nearly four decades family home evening one of the most successful religious programs fostering intergenerational connections and the nurturing of families This at least is the ideal Among some seasoned practitioners family home evening has been called the family fight that begins and ends with prayer The Mormon humorist Robert Kirby has referred to it as family home screaming, Enough With the Trolley Problem, A year old philosophical thought experiment has been central to the debate about autonomous vehicles It s time to give it up, You know the drill by now A runaway trolley is careening down a track There are five workers ahead sure to be killed if the trolley reaches them You can throw a lever to switch the trolley to a neighboring track but there s a worker on that one as well who would likewise be doomed Do you hit the switch and kill one person or do nothing and kill five, That s the most famous version of the trolley problem a philosophical thought experiment popularized in the s There are other variants the next most famous asks if you d push a fat man off a bridge to stop the trolley rather than killing even one of the supposedly slim workers In addition to its primary role as a philosophical exercise the trolley problem has been used a tool in and more recently it has become the standard for asking moral questions about self driving cars, Facebook s Ideological Imperialism, Andrew Bosworth s memo may seem insidious but its logic used to be very popular, It s mostly forgotten now but for a time expanding the reach of social networks making Facebook Twitter and others like it as large as possible was an avowed foreign policy goal of the United States That is at least what the secretary of state said in the early days of this decade in a speech at the Newseum in Washington D C, New technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress but the United States does Hillary Clinton We stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas And we recognize that the world s information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it, It was a declaration of purpose for the young Obama administration and Clinton backed it up with money The State Department would fund social networks around the world she said and it would help develop software that dissidents could use to get around online censorship But she also framed the goal as part of something larger On the eve of World War II Franklin Roosevelt to which all people are entitled the freedom of speech the freedom of worship the freedom from want and the freedom from fear, The President Sang Amazing Grace, Joan Baez performs the mournful song in a new animated video that remembers Obama s visit to Charleston, Failure A Modern Success Story, An altruistic entrepreneur is

buy Humana, Walmart may turn to an unlikely source to attract more shoppers and fight off Amazon, is in the to buy the health insurance giant according to a Wall Street Journal published late Thursday A Walmart Humana deal would transform America s largest retailer and shake up the health care industry, Humana valued at billion would be the largest acquisition in Walmart s history Walmart already one of the largest pharmacies in the country could present itself as a one stop shop for Humana s million policyholders and bring in new customers with an expanded focus on health and wellness, The deal would also allow Walmart to control health care for its employees and defend itself against Amazon as it creeps further into health care, Health care is a major growth sector said Neil Saunders managing director of GlobalData Retail a consulting firm Moving onto this turf would give Walmart a whole new arena in which to expand and would be valuable at a time when its retail margins are under pressure, Walmart s physical stores in the United States already compete with dollar stores traditional grocery stores and discount grocers The company has expanded online but its, Walmart has maxed out its existing market base of less affluent Americans and is looking for ways to find more customers according to Paula Rosenblum a managing partner at Retail Systems Research, Dollar stores have already taken away lower income customers and Amazon has limited Walmart s ability to attract wealthier Americans, Rosenblum said a merger with Humana would fit into CEO Doug McMillon s strategy to bring in new shoppers and make it a more attractive place to work, Under McMillon Walmart has bought brands such as Jet the online shopping site and Bonobos It has also in part to fight criticism that it underpays workers, With Humana Rosenblum speculated that Walmart might offerhealth insurance for employees to retain them in a tight labor market Walmart is the largest private employer in the country It employs million Americans according to its most recent quarterly filing, A takeover is only one option the companies are discussing the Journal reported Walmart already partners with Humana on a Medicare prescription benefit and the companies could expand that partnership, Humana s policyholders include millions in Medicare related plans Taking full control of Humana could push them to fill their prescriptions at Walmart stores and then go shopping for everyday products said Ana Gupte an analyst for Leerink Partners, Scooping up Humana would also allow Walmart to delve deeper into its customers health care needs said Gurpreet Singh partner in the health services sector at PwC a consulting firm, Access to Humana s medical data would give Walmart more insight into its customers and the people who live around its stores If a certain community has high rates of heart disease or diabetes Walmart could display and advertise items that address those conditions more prominently for example, It would provide Walmart with better data and information on what to promote and what to provide for certain populations he said, Buying Humana could also bolster Walmart s fledgling foray into retail health clinics in a handful of its locations, Insurers generally employ medical professionals such as registered nurses to assist policyholders with basic care A combined company could offer that to store customers as well an enticing notion at a time when more health care is being delivered outside of hospital settings, In addition to selling prescription pills Walmart could develop a pretty attractive line of business with walk in or by appointment clinics said Erik Gordon a professor at the University of Michigan s Ross School of Business, The potential deal is just the latest to roil the health care sector in recent months, said in December that it would buy and announced earlier this month that it would a pharmacy benefits manager has made a bid for the roughly stores that Walgreens didn t purchase, Part of the recent merger frenzy stems from health care companies fear that, Amazon has made its own inroads CEO Jeff Bezos announced a partnership in January with Warren Buffett s and Jamie Dimon aimed at reducing the companies and their employees health care costs, Amazon has also rolled out a line of private label over the counter medicines and is

url_data=[Bill Clinton There Are No Great Generations Just Different Problems, Most Popular, Reuters Pool New, The office where I met Clinton high in the UN headquarters building belongs to another era It is an institution built for a world of the past one based on Cold War rivalries and the last century s balance of power It was Clinton s first day in the cramped space and his entourage of bodyguards and assistants were stumbling over one another in the confines The Secret Service men dispatched a young press aide to inquire why so many UN staffers were loitering near the elevators though it was clear that they were simply trying to catch a glimpse of the ex president, Is this the office an exhausted Clinton asked after shaking my hand I nodded as did most of the swarm that followed him The entire place felt as if it hadn t been touched since the early fifties when the building was raised a lone skyscraper above an otherwise flat block on the East Side of Manhattan I heard him chuckle to a staffer as he stepped inside You know what wahut the final word came out It kinda reminds me of Mad Men Have you seen that show yet, Couples Speak Honestly About Open Relationships, Non monogamous couples speak candidly about the challenges and rewards of their unconventional lifestyle, About the Author, Most Popular, Donald Trump Doesn t Understand Community Colleges, In a speech on Thursday he revealed he doesn t appreciate the vital role they play in the country s education system and economy, During a speech on Thursday President Trump revealed a striking ignorance of one of the pillars of his country s educational system In the course of promoting his infrastructure plan he a bit perplexingly dismissed the country s community colleges suggesting he doesn t know what purpose they serve We do not know what a community college means he told the crowd in an Ohio training facility for construction apprentices moments after expressing nostalgia for the vocational schools that flourished when he was growing up schools that offered hands on training in fields such as welding and cosmetology, He seemed to have a better grasp on these latter schools analogizing them to the apprenticeship programs he was promoting in his effort to create high paying infrastructure jobs The implication as he brushed aside one form of higher education and lauded another was that he d like to resuscitate short term training opportunities and phase out community colleges in the name of workforce development, The Case Against High School Sports, The United States routinely spends more tax dollars per high school athlete than per high school math student unlike most countries worldwide And we wonder why we lag in international education rankings, thousands of teenagersmove to the United States from all over the world for all kinds of reasons They observe everything in their new country with fresh eyes including basic features of American life that most of us never stop to consider, One element of our education system consistently surprises them Sports are a big deal here says Jenny who moved to America from South Korea with her family in Shawnee High her public school in southern New Jersey fields teams in sports over the course of the school year including golf and bowling Its campus has lush grass fields six tennis courts and an athletic Hall of Fame They have days when teams dress up in Hawaiian clothes or pajamas just because We re the soccer team Jenny says To protect the privacy of Jenny and other students in this story only their first names are used, Immigrants Give America a Foreign Policy Advantage, History proves they can help the U S keep other countries in check, It has often been thought that the composition of the American public consisting as it does of immigrants from so many lands is a vulnerability in foreign policy that for example German immigrants would harbor affinities for their land of origin and become disloyal during the world wars The argument was taken to a shameful extreme with the internment of Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor What has received less attention is the extent to which America s immigrant fabric can be a foreign policy advantage even a threat to other countries That is what British Prime Minister Palmerston feared and what President Lincoln stoked to forestall British recognition of the Confederacy during the Civil War The result was an important inhibition on Great Britain then the most powerful state of the international order, America s Moral Malady, The nation s problem isn t that we don t have enough money It s that we don t have the moral capacity to face what ails society, I Martin Luther King Jr visited homes in the hamlet of Marks Mississippi Later he remembered the hundreds of children who lacked shoes A mother told King that her children had no clothes for school The Nobel laureate wept openly They didn t even have any blankets to cover their children up on a cold night he recalled And I said to myself Then he vowed We are going to say in no uncertain terms that we aren t going to accept it any longer We ve got to go to Washington in big numbers, Why Is Trump Turning Against Russia Now, The president s lingering insecurity about his legitimacy might explain his willingness to punish the Kremlin for a poisoning in London but not for meddling in the election, No single stand has hobbled Donald Trump s presidency more than his attitude toward Russia, During the presidential campaign he conspicuously praised Vladimir Putin and refused to condemn his seizure of Crimea Trump also publicly called for Russia to release emails hacked from Hillary Clinton something his aides said was a joke Trump s perceived softness on Putin seems to have encouraged advisers like George Papadopoulos and perhaps Michael Flynn to make overtures to the Kremlin whether Trump intended that or not, Once in office Trump s apparent Russophilia has continued to dog him and his eagerness to stifle or shut down any investigation that touched on it has directly or indirectly produced tremendous legal and political peril for Trump Polls show support for Special Counel Robert Mueller concern that Trump obstructed justice and worries that the president doesn t take Russia seriously enough Russia is hardly the only problem the president has but it is the largest and most multifarious No matter what Trump does for the rest of his term he will be unable to undo the damage of his strange stance toward Russia so far, The Diet That Might Cure Depression, Several studies show that healthy eating is connected with better mood, At the turn of the th century prominent physicians who were trying to understand where mental illness comes from seized on a new theory autointoxication Intestinal microbes these doctors suggested are actually dangerous to their human hosts They fatigue melancholia and the neuroses as a historical article in the journal recounts, The control of man s diet is readily accomplished but mastery over his intestinal bacterial flora is not a doctor named Bond Stow in the in The innumerable examples of autointoxication that one sees in his daily walks in life is proof thereof malaise total lack of ambition so that every effort in life is a burden mental depression often bordering upon melancholia, Chicago s Awful Divide, Americans are flocking to big cities to find good jobs opportunities that remain disproportionately out of reach for the poorest residents already living there, CHICAGO Americans hear a lot these days about the country s urban rural divide Rural counties are poorer urban ones richer Rural areas are losing jobs urban ones are gaining them People with a college education are leaving rural areas They re moving to urban places, Behind this divergence lies a straightforward story The twin forces of globalization and technological change are a handful of big urban areas while resources are drained from the heartland leaving it often devoid of opportunity and prosperity But this neat division rural versus urban erases another part of the story of America s changing economy the pressure that those twin forces are exerting within cities pulling some people up to the very top while pushing others to an unforgiving bottom In some prosperous cities such as Chicago where the number of has grown fourfold since people at the bottom are struggling as much as they always have if not more illustrating that it s not just the white rural poor who are being left behind in today s economy The disconnect is why Andrew Diamond the author of has called Chicago a combination of Manhattan smashed against Detroit, Mormons Weekly Family Ritual Is an Antidote to Fast Paced Living, Family home evening regular time set aside for praying and playing has taken on new relevance a century after it was conceived, Every Monday evening Mormons around the world pause as families Together they pray sing play games eat snacks This is all standard fare for many American households but the difference is that for Mormons it s built into every Monday night or sometimes another night and it has an official deceptively generic sounding name family home evening, The weekly gathering is far more than a family game night Vern Bengtson a sociologist who ran a major study of at home religious practices that spanned nearly four decades family home evening one of the most successful religious programs fostering intergenerational connections and the nurturing of families This at least is the ideal Among some seasoned practitioners family home evening has been called the family fight that begins and ends with prayer The Mormon humorist Robert Kirby has referred to it as family home screaming, Facebook s Ideological Imperialism, Andrew Bosworth s memo may seem insidious but its logic used to be very popular, It s mostly forgotten now but for a time expanding the reach of social networks making Facebook Twitter and others like it as large as possible was an avowed foreign policy goal of the United States That is at least what the secretary of state said in the early days of this decade in a speech at the Newseum in Washington D C, New technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress but the United States does Hillary Clinton We stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas And we recognize that the world s information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it, It was a declaration of purpose for the young Obama administration and Clinton backed it up with money The State Department would fund social networks around the world she said and it would help develop software that dissidents could use to get around online censorship But she also framed the goal as part of something larger On the eve of World War II Franklin Roosevelt to which all people are entitled the freedom of speech the freedom of worship the freedom from want and the freedom from fear, Enough With the Trolley Problem, A year old philosophical thought experiment has been central to the debate about autonomous vehicles It s time to give it up, You know the drill by now A runaway trolley is careening down a track There are five workers ahead sure to be killed if the trolley reaches them You can throw a lever to switch the trolley to a neighboring track but there s a worker on that one as well who would likewise be doomed Do you hit the switch and kill one person or do nothing and kill five, That s the most famous version of the trolley problem a philosophical thought experiment popularized in the s There are other variants the next most famous asks if you d push a fat man off a bridge to stop the trolley rather than killing even one of the supposedly slim workers In addition to its primary role as a philosophical exercise the trolley problem has been used a tool in and more recently it has become the standard for asking moral questions about self driving cars, The President Sang Amazing Grace, Joan Baez performs the mournful song in a new animated video

programs like Southwest United Hyatt and Marriot This is a great way to make the most of your points for example if you move your bonus points to the Hyatt Gold Passport program they would be worth according to our Or if you choose to redeem them through Chase Ultimate Rewards your points are worth more There is a annual fee that s waived the first year but this could be more than worth it depending on your spending patterns Overall Chase Sapphire Preferred is an outstanding travel rewards credit card the features some real flexibility in the way you can use your points, Best Card for

particularly student cards And on top of all the great rewards there is a and there is a balance transfer fee, Want to learn more about the cards detailed in this post Visit our to see how our top picks compare to other cards on the market, Related Posts, We use CapitalOne Venture Love love that card We travel to Europe a lot no transaction fee ever They are very prompt when I turn in my rewards within a day or two credited to our account, Cap one was our card of choice for travel but the way they redeem travel charges sometimes is not to ones benefits For example if one charges a flight for they deduct points there are levels of reward paybacks and often they rip you off by charging a higher level of rewards points than the actual cost Bank of America rewards poits equal the plane or hotel price and give one and one half points per dollar spent and chards no annual fee, I have cards with Capital One I am Percent satisfied with their service and terms Had to call on a couple of occasions and found out how helpful their agents are I highly recommend Capital One, I presently have a Chase visa that is linked to United Miles Explorer I have many auto bill payment accounts for my expenses and use the card for a fair amount of air travel and have accumulated air travel points Is it worth my time and should I consider moving the card into the Chase Sapphire Preferred I have excellent credit, We have used Capital One Venture cars as our primary card for several years back on everything and an annual Fee per year We pay EVERY purchase by credit card even a cup of coffee at Starbucks so the adds up quickly Of course to stay ahead you have to pay off that balance every month Repeating bills like electric phone etc we charge on another card because Capital One changed our card twice in the last years they never verified this but we think they might have been hacked This hasn t happened for over a year so seems to be ok now Courteous professional customer service and they send us a check on a designated day every year Great card, Bank Americard Cash Rewards is the very best credit card available, I am surprised the CapitalOne Venture card has not been mentioned We get back on all our purchased applied to any travel expenses past or present or miles credit Although there is an annual fee the staff at Capital One are always professional pleasant and never hesitate to call us when they discover fraudulent activity They have also gone to bat for us when we ve been unfairly charged by a retailer Love CapitalOne, A question if Tasha Lockyer is reading comments and replying What is the best card for world traveling if your company is paying for the flights and some expenses A card that is accepted in most of Asia Africa Europe and South America So basically anywhere Thanks, Best credit card for me is one where I earn a high cashback no interest and no annual fee I couldn t care less how high the interest rate is because I m never going to carry a balance If I don t have the money to pay cash for something I don t buy it simple, Citi Double Cash back is my primary card but it has several weaknesses they are extremely slow with crediting accounts and they only pay out in increments In other words you have to spend and pay back to get your back Then you get nothing until you have spent and paid back another Of course you could settle for the cash back without paying off your balance but the interest rates on the card is higher than average If you carry a balance you are going to be loosing money big time, Capitol One Quicksilver and Chase Freedom Unlimited pay and they don t play games like Citi I m left wondering if the extra is worth the hassle Citi puts you through about per spent and paid back, CitiCard offers cash back on everything you purchase with no exceptions It has no annual fee, chase ink the best, I find it amazing the Capital One Venture card is not on here Although there is an annual fee you general back on ALL purchases and when I got it months ago it had a signing bonus equal to I believe It was high I also have an AmEx Blue Sky rewards preferred which was pretty great with the included in flight credit as well as cash back, I ve had a Discover Card since but almost never used it because the interest rate was around I have another card so it s a no brainer My FICO score is always good between I called Discover with this information to have them lower my interest rate They did but only by pts Long story shorter it s taken calls over a period of yrs to get where I am now Interest Not fabulous but a lot better I ve learned it takes time patience and consistency or FICO scores etc to affect any meaningful change, Leave a Reply, These responses are not provided or

newer treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is a group of medications known as biologics Biologics are made from proteins produced by living cells in a laboratory Here s what you should know about these medications and how they may be able to help your psoriasis, Unlike systemic drugs that affect your entire immune system biologics target specific parts of your immune system Psoriatic biologics block a type of immune cell called a T cell or certain proteins such as TNF alpha or interleukins and These cells and proteins lead to the inflammation and overproduction of skin cells seen in psoriasis, Enbrel etanercept Humira adalimumab Remicade infliximab and Simponi golimumab are psoriatic drugs that block TNF alpha Stelara ustekinumab is a biologic that targets and blocks inflammation producing interleukin and interleukin Cosentyx secukinumab and Taltz Ixekizumab block interleukin A Otezla apremilast blocks the PDE enzyme to control inflammation, Biologics are best for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis Your doctor may also consider biologics if your psoriasis hasn t responded well to other treatments or if you re having bad side effects from other drugs TNF alpha blockers can even help slow the joint damage of psoriatic arthritis, Most biologics for the treatment of psoriasis are taken by injection or by intravenous IV infusion Some injections can be given by yourself or a family member while others may need to be administered by a health care provider at a doctor s office or infusion center A twice daily oral tablet called Otezla apremilast is FDA approved for treatment of plaque psoriasis, How well biologics work for your psoriasis will vary from person to person Results also depend on the specific medication and dose you re on Remicade infliximab and Humira adalimumab tend to work more quickly You may notice improvement within two weeks Other biologics like Enbrel etanercept may take four to eight weeks, It s important to discuss possible side effects with your doctor before starting any new medication Biologics can increase your risk of infection The most common side effects include respiratory infections injection site reactions and flu like symptoms Contact your doctor right away if you have fever or cough or if you notice swelling or a rash around your injection site, There has been some concern about a possible rare side effect of TNF alpha blocking medications an increased risk of lymphoma which is a type of cancer The U S Food and Drug Administration has concluded there isn t enough data right now to know if these drugs increase risk of lymphoma in people with psoriasis, Biologics are costly to research and produce which makes them expensive medications Pricing for psoriasis biologics varies widely In a report prices ranged from to a year Voluntary enrollment in a psoriasis treatment clinical trial may eliminate the cost of treatment during the course of the study, There are many approaches to treating psoriasis All the biologics currently available can be combined with other treatments such as phototherapy or topical medications Talk with your doctor about whether using other treatments along with a biologic is right for your psoriasis, There are newer treatment options for psoriasis, One of the newer treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is a group of medications known as biologics Biologics are made from proteins produced by living cells in a laboratory Here s what you should know about these medications and

help Subscribe to the or follow him on and He s jdsutter on Snapchat You can shape this coverage, Majuro Marshall Islands CNN, ngie Hepisus heard her nephew Mark banging on the door and screaming in Marshallese, It s flooding It s flooding Get out, Her thoughts went immediately to her family on this fragile coastline in the middle of the Pacific a place under increasing threat from climate change, The Marshall Islands is a collection of atolls and five islands located between Hawaii and Australia, One of her cousins woke up that morning last spring to find herself floating her plywood home filling up like an aquarium Another who lives in a house where the roof is held down by evenly spaced rocks was so bewildered by the rush of water that had invaded her house at a m that she actually licked her arm to be sure that yes this was saltwater and no she wasn t having a nightmare, Then there was Jitiam her wild haired nephew who was trying to tie his family s pigs to a tree trunk to prevent them from washing away And Roselinta who was sleeping with her year old son Shiro in a house that was being carried inland by the storm and the unusually high tide that accompanied it, My mind and my heart were pounding Angie told me, It s like not again, She grabbed the Bible and all the family members she could, They waded out into the dark, Out here in the middle of the Pacific somewhere between Australia and Hawaii there s a place where no one has the luxury of denying the existence of climate change People here in the Marshall Islands are living it Have been living it, They ve internalized the gravest of predictions that the Marshall Islands this loose collection of no elevation coral atolls likely will be submerged beneath the waves as humans continue to warm the atmosphere and the oceans continue to rise They ve seen their homes flood frequently seen the tides getting higher seen their lives threatened Mojje Anungar watched the remains of his infant son George who died at months wash into the Pacific from a coastal graveyard, Video Climate migration, I m still shell shocked he told me through an interpreter Before this kind of thing never happened, A few people already are making the difficult decision to leave this country in part because of the frequency of floods and the threat of climate change and I found some of them seeking refuge in the most unexpected of places, In the nine days I spent in Majuro the crescent shaped capital of the Marshall Islands I learned there is nowhere on these islands to escape the floods People I was told seek shelter on the second stories of buildings or by climbing up the trunks of coconut trees The only hill to speak of in Majuro is a bridge that s built over an inlet, Perhaps nowhere is the precarious nature of this country s geography more apparent than Rita a crowded neighborhood at the very tip of Majuro That s where Angie and her family live where they faced the inundation event last spring, I don t think these islands are going to last that long Angie told me, Disappearing country disappearing stories, I documented my journey to the Marshall Islands on Snapchat which is a social network for disappearing stories Below you ll find a few examples of what will be lost if this country is submerged by rising seas, Once a big tide comes we re all going to be washed away, For Angie and her family the March storm felt like the beginning of the end like the ocean always an ally and friend finally had turned on them, Seeing is believing, It s disturbingly easy to write off a country you ve never seen, I didn t realize that until I visited the Marshall Islands until I watched five hours of sapphire ocean pass beneath my airplane window between Honolulu and Majuro completely unable to pull my eyes from the wet infinity below, No boats no land Only water salt speck waves cresting on a backdrop of blue clouds casting coffee stain shadows on the surface of the Pacific, I felt my chest tighten up, All this nothing, Where was this freaking place, The answer offered little comfort Majuro appeared as a delicate necklace of land draped around a turquoise lagoon some of it barely wider than an airport runway I d read plenty about the Marshall Islands before hopping on a plane in Atlanta hours earlier But none of it prepared me for the sight of this tiny little atoll this coke line of sand and palm tossed out in the middle of the terrifying sea, No wonder this place is at risk for climate change, It s barely treading water, I embarked on this journey to the middle of nowhere because CNN readers voted for me to look into climate refugees as part of my Two series on climate change That idea came in the form of a question from Kelly a year old reader in San Jose California who asked What happens if thousands or tens of thousands are displaced due to rising sea levels or desertification Where do they go, More than voted in a poll that commissioned this story, As the results came in I started searching for a suitable case study There are countries like Bangladesh where millions likely will be displaced by rising seas But from Refugees International drew my attention to low lying island nations that could vanish if seas rise as much as or meters, Kiribati the Maldives the Marshall Islands, All of these barely peek out over the surface of the ocean, And all of them literally could be wiped off the map, That s not an immediate prospect definitely not five years or Even But it could happen within our lifetimes and certainly within the next generation s, Scientists say we easily could warm the atmosphere by degrees Celsius by the end of the century and if you call up a scientist like a professor of ocean physics from Germany s Potsdam University he ll say ominous things like this Even limiting warming to degrees in my view will still commit some island nations and coastal cities to drowning In other words See ya Marshall Islands, The tone is almost nonchalant, Not because he doesn t care he does But because he says this stuff so often and I hear this stuff so often that it almost starts to seem expected Easy to intellectualize As if an entire country culture history and language are logical externalities of our fossil fuel addiction Oh yeah drowning islands Heard that story, It s quite another thing however to walk down the tarmac in Majuro, Many coral atolls in the remote Pacific just barely peek out above sea level making them particularly vulnerable to climate change, There you see the broken sea wall crumbled by floods that in recent years covered the runways and shut down the airport temporarily You see sand piled up along the road as if pleading with the ocean to stay back You feel the thick air warm silk on your skin You wipe the fog off your glasses And you take in the sweet smell of the ocean all brine and crab and palm frond, If you re lucky you meet a Marshallese princess former ambassador to the United Nations and daughter of this country s first president She met me at the plane threw a lei around my neck a loop of fragrant yellow flowers she picked herself She welcomed me with a Marshallese word that is as ubiquitous as it is magical, Iakwe, Meaning Hello I love you and You are a rainbow, How could you not love this place, Amatlain insisted that I sit down have some coconut milk right from the coconut but with a straw because well this is and hear about her country s existential fight to convince the world that this place these people exist and that they matter enough to blunt the force of climate change, Climate change is real she said, Seeing is believing, I d learn she was right, Because when you re standing all the way out here you have to wonder How could this place this charming sweaty smelly place vanish, Or more accurately How could we make it vanish, The melody of it has changed, The biggest flood was more than a year ago but she still doesn t sleep, Is it high tide King tide Any chance for a swell, Angie Hepisus checks tide and weather apps constantly and wakes her husband Timothy to be sure she hasn t missed something critical, Outside the ocean laps at the land only paces from her bedroom wall, She hears it out there churning like a washing machine, She s not able to let her guard down unable to find peace, The sound of the ocean it used to put me to sleep It s like my lullaby Angie told me Now it s more like slamming and hammering It s so noisy It scares me at night It s changed The melody of it has changed, It s not the same song I used to love, The year old grew up in the teal concrete house at the edge of the land she her siblings and their parents all living under one roof Marshallese families aren t bound by terms like nuclear so it isn t uncommon for a gaggle of cousins aunties nephews and great uncles to live together as well It makes sense when you know how the land the precious little land is handled All of it is owned by several chiefs and it s managed on behalf of the family community People here mostly don t pay rent they ask for room to build on the family land and it s granted free Land rights are passed down from a mother to her children So this plot of land on the coast in Rita is not just any place it s a family heirloom a part of their identity, Ukulele music is everywhere in the Marshall Islands The instrument here has three of the usual four strings, Angie is the third youngest of the children and the youngest girl But she s the acting matriarch ensuring that dozens of family members many of them living on this precarious stretch of coastline are fed clothed and kept safe She s also the family historian safeguarding and updating documents pertaining to the family s royal heritage and their land here in Rita and elsewhere, These are her responsibilities for perhaps three reasons First she s bossy as hell As a kid Angie s siblings nicknamed her big eyes and reporter because she saw what other family members were doing wrong and was quick to tattle Her world is one of right and wrong and she ll certainly tell you if you re wrong Second she has arguably the best most stable job of her siblings working as an executive assistant at the Bank of Marshall Islands in Majuro And finally and most importantly she s here, The others are not, The house where Roselinta and her year old lived before the flood What remains is a slab of concrete Mark the nephew who woke her as the waters were rising Jitiam who was trying to tie up the pigs before they washed away, They are gone, We are not a small island country, I spent much of my time in the Marshall Islands trying to figure out what will be lost if we let this country drown beneath the rising ocean I decided to document these wanderings on Snapchat an app for stories that vanish after you view them, I called them disappearing stories from a disappearing country, Annoyingly meta I know, A premise for my findings To really get the Marshall Islands you need to understand that this is a country that s far more water than land The total area of the country including the Pacific Ocean is nearly three times that of Texas, Subtract the ocean and you re left with land that would fill Washington D C, We are not a small island country We are a big ocean country with a conscience that we d like to share said the foreign minister, The first people are thought to have arrived in the Marshall Islands to years ago likely coming by canoe from Southeast Asia Think about that A voyage across the Pacific by outrigger canoe That s the kind of thing that just doesn t happen in the SpaceX era well unless you re Alson Kelen director of a nonprofit called, I met Alson a smiley year old who looks like the surfer dude version of George Foreman at his canoe building workshop on the Majuro lagoon, Outside a couple dozen young men were hacking away at a breadfruit tree turning it into a vessel They were planning a mile voyage out to sea which is nothing for Kelen who has ridden outrigger canoes from the Marshalls to both Hawaii and New Zealand a trip where the sun blistered the bottoms of his feet, A lot of people navigate with their heads he told me sitting in his office a stick and shell map of the currents of the Marshall Islands nailed to the ceiling above us We navigate with our stomachs We feel the swells and we know where we are, Alson doesn t want to brag about these feats and is quick to say he s not a master navigator His expertise he insists is the art of canoe building, For details he deferred to the experts, By lying on his back in the bilge of his canoe and sensing the motion of the canoe the skilled pilot can fix his position at night even without looking at the sea for the movement of the canoe alone will tell him what kinds of swells are acting on it, This strange skill is especially incredible and necessary when you consider the Marshall Islands are so low to the sea that they re basically invisible from a distance, To know where an island is you have to feel its presence, That takes work so training for master navigators starts in early childhood said Joseph Genz an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii in Hilo The youthful trainees are placed for hours at a time in mini canoes and floated out onto the water so that they can tune their stomachs to the waves, This knowledge is very sensitive the professor said by e mail, It s also exceedingly rare these days Alson however hopes to bring back the art He s already training dropouts to build canoes And one day he wants to help them learn to navigate their oceanic nation, He told me he d be the last person to leave these islands if they sunk beneath rising seas that he d be out here after everyone else treading water, But he also sees this training as an insurance policy, If these kids have to abandon their country at least they ll have some skills, Maybe this piece of their heritage can survive, Or at least they ll know it existed, Adios Marshall Islands, In Majuro ask anyone from Angie and her family to kids you find playing basketball on the street using plastic buckets for hoops where they would move if the islands keep flooding and you tend to get one of three answers Hawaii which makes sense because it s close ish and it s also a collection of islands Washington state which is freakishly cold compared to Majuro but still is on the West Coast, And then Arkansas, Springdale Arkansas to be exact, I was so perplexed that I decided to pay a visit to Springdale, It s a woodsy town of rolling hills blinking strip malls and taquerias, Hundreds of miles from an ocean, As landlocked as they come, It s the largest Marshallese population in the continental United States said Carmen Chong Gum the consul general of the Marshall Islands in Springdale, Yeah let me repeat that The government of the Marshall Islands has an official consular office in Springdale Arkansas It shares a building with a barbershop an attorney and a gadget repair store called Undead Electronics, The population there is so sizable that I met a candidate for Marshallese senate Tadashi Lometo who was making a campaign stop in town, If you win in the States you will also win back home he said We have a large community here in Arkansas, How large is what s incredible though, The Marshall Islands is home to about, There are Marshallese in Northwest Arkansas according to the consulate, Ten thousand people Nearly of the country s population, And they vote by mail, Photos Life in the Marshall Islands, Kids on the street in Majuro Marshall Islands in the remote Pacific can tell you anything you want to know about climate change They know the seas are rising This basketball court is next to the foundation of a house destroyed in a recent flood, Marshallese people are known as master canoe builders and navigators Including the ocean the nation is three times the size of Texas But it only has as much land as Washington D C We are not a small island country said Tony de Brum the foreign minister We are a big ocean country, Rositha Anwel said she woke up to find herself floating during a March flood Some neighbors moved away but Anwel can t imagine leaving her family s home on the water This is where I grew up she said, The kemem or first birthday party is an important rite of passage in the Marshall Islands These celebrations often are larger than weddings and hundreds can attend, Waves crashed over this home in Majuro during a recent flood according to residents Some say they want to leave this precarious spot but don t have the money to do so, The Marshall Islands lives in a delicate conversation with the sea The Pacific Ocean brings life and food but lately some residents have started to fear the rising tides, Angie Hepisus recently buried her brother one of siblings behind her home on the coast in Majuro Other nearby grave sites on the island have washed away during floods, Wina Anmontha says her daughter Roselinta moved from Majuro to the United States in part because of fears that floods are becoming more common here, The Marshall Islands is an independent country but uses U S currency and has a contractual relationship with the United States Marshallese people can live and work in the United States without a visa, Reef fish breadfruit rice and pandanus fruit are the staples of a traditional Marshallese diet Junk food and soda have become common too and obesity rates are high in the islands, Angie Hepisus and her family said they decided not to repair this house after it was damaged in floods Land in the Marshall Islands is managed communally by chiefs so families often live in clusters together, When floodwaters rush in residents say they tie their animals to trees to try to keep them from disappearing into the Pacific Ocean, Emi Anwel woke up to find water in her home during a recent flood She licked her arm to be sure that yes the water tasted salty That s how she knew the ocean was coming for her, Flooding is only the most obvious impact of sea level rise Trees and crops along the coast die when they re saturated with saltwater Supplies of freshwater also become contaminated Some researchers say the islands likely will become uninhabitable long before they re submerged by rising sea levels, So how did they end up here, Run around town asking that question and you ll get one name John Moody I couldn t wait to meet him to find out how this all happened, But there s a problem several folks told me John Moody s dead, One woman was so sure of this that she pulled up John Moody s tombstone on Google Images when I told her I was trying to find him, But it turns out John Moody is not dead, Just in hiding, After engaging what felt like half the Marshallese population of Springdale I tracked down John Moody blood in his cheeks and living about an hour and minutes by car from Springdale He s situated on top of a hill in a beige double wide trailer Buzz cut and policeman mustache Thirteen chickens running around out back, He keeps to himself he told me because he s so well known in Springdale that people stop him at traffic lights yelling Hey John Moody, It s the price you pay for being the original Marshallese in Arkansas, That s what they call me he said Pioneer, John moved to the United States from the Marshall Islands in before the frequent flooding that Angie s family is now experiencing but around the time that seas started rising because of a stark uptick in fossil fuel emissions His first stop Oklahoma where he went to school on a recommendation He got a summer job at a chicken processing plant and decided he liked that better The work led him to Springdale which is where Tyson and other poultry companies are based, Soon he had or relatives living with him all working on factory lines dissecting chicken parts with knives for wages unthinkable on the islands, I said Adios Marshall Islands I m gone he told me smiling, Throngs of migrants followed many looking for work or better schools for their children a chance to learn English Marshallese people can live and work legally in the United States without a visa because of the which allows the United States to keep a military base on one of the atolls It s hard not to see this as more of a system of reparations for nuclear testing than as a favor to the islands by the way Starting after World War II the United States detonated nuclear weapons on some remote atolls in the Marshall Islands relocating entire populations and exposing others to cancer and disease causing radiation, Now however a new wave of migrants is emerging Those like Angie s family members who worry their nation will be flooded, Roselinta Mark Jitiam Shiro, You may have guessed it, I met all of them in Arkansas, Roselinta who was living in the shack that floated away during the March flood in Majuro told me she likes life better here She lives in a second floor three bedroom apartment with family members A dozen or so pairs of flip flops are stacked up just inside the door The apartment s walls are covered in family photos and flowers made from coconut husks and dried pandanus leaves, I asked Roselinta what she liked so much about this place, Her answer surprised me, It s far from the ocean she told me through an interpreter, And that means it s safe, In God s hands, In trying to understand this big ocean country I figured I needed to get out on the water Fortunately Alson Kelen the canoe guru offered to give me a lift, We didn t go far just across Majuro s kidney bean lagoon but even that short journey was revelatory Majuro essentially is one road but if you re driving up and down it day after day dodging kids and roosters that weave in and out of a steady stream of traffic you start to forget just how isolated this location is how fragile, From the water however the land vanishes, The outrigger landed on Ejit a tooth shaped island with no cars or roads I roamed around with a resident slash security guard David He walked with a heavy limp and wore a thick beard even though it s always sweat through your T shirt weather here, Most residents of this island came originally from the Bikini Atoll he told me They were relocated a number of times after the United States conducted nuclear tests on their remote islands A hydrogen bomb times as powerful as those dropped on Japan during World War II was exploded on Bikini Atoll in after the war, As testament to this awful history I saw young children running around with Ejit Elementary School T shirts that featured cartoons of that nuclear blast on the back, The text translated from Marshallese read Everything s in God s hands, Or The hands of the bomb makers I thought, Eventually I sat down beneath a breadfruit tree with its leaves as long as a forearm and its starchy fruit to talk with Ken Amlek a year old with piercing raven eyes whose family originated in Bikini He explains its long dark history in a yep that s how it is simplicity They tested the bomb and that s why we re here, Angie Hepisus says the sound of the ocean once was her lullaby Now it scares her, Now he said this island which he and his family never liked to begin with is flooding frequently The land is curved like a bowl and it fills up at the center with saltwater he said He wants the United States to pay to relocate him You could see a move as a form of climate change reparations similar to the million the United States has spent trying to make up for the nuclear tests which not only evicted people from their ancestral homes but also were linked to cancer, To date although China isn t far behind the United States is the So why not hold the United States liable, Maybe climate change is the new nuclear testing, Slow moving and less intentional, But just as threatening, I must say this argument started to work on me when I was on Ejit, Partly that s because Ejit is a place wedged between worlds I saw girls playing checkers with rocks on a carved out table while a friend tapped at her iPhone There s no running water and limited electricity in some homes Ken showed me the rain catchment tank he drinks from and it was full of pinkie finger size fish which he said are there on purpose because they eat the mosquitoes When the tide s low though you can walk across the coral reef to Majuro where there s an airport hospital restaurants and a handful of Wi Fi hot spots Life on Ejit and especially the remote outer islands of this country is hard Leprosy remains a scourge obesity rates are high access to medical care inadequate, Maybe the solution is to shove this country into the climate changed future to accept the realities now and deal with them accordingly There s no international law to protect would be climate refugees Walter Kaelin envoy of the chairmanship of the a group that focuses on climate change and migration told me They can t seek asylum in other nations or haven t been able to A man from Kiribati according to news reports tried to seek asylum as a climate refugee in New Zealand The courts rejected him And while people from the Marshall Islands can live and work legally in the United States refugees from Kiribati or the Maldives for example would have nowhere else to go legally if their island nations disappeared As a Plan B Kiribati reportedly purchased more than acres in Fiji Academics who study this sort of planning tend to say it s healthy They call it migration with dignity Rather than a desperate flood of refugees, Some island nations want to be able to choose when to go said Walter They want to be able to choose more or less where they go, In that sense they want to remain masters of their own destiny, Think of it A planned exodus before the country disappears before freshwater supplies get tainted with salt before saltwater intrusion kills all the fruit trees before floods are so frequent that people have no choice but to try to move away, I started to think maybe Ken Amlek is right maybe the United States should pay now to relocate anyone from the Marshall Islands who s willing to leave A one way flight from Majuro to the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport goes for at the moment when reserved one month in advance Duration hours Stops in Honolulu San Francisco and Houston Some families save up for a year or more to make that trip Others like Angie s cousins living in plywood and tin homes seven or more family members crammed into one room never could do that, Based on that fare it would cost million to fly every Marshallese person to Arkansas Maybe we should provide the funding make this thing orderly, Face the issue head on, Establish the New Marshall Islands, Location Springdale, You have to hold them, On first glance the islands have nothing in common with Arkansas, Just look at Angie s family s arrangements, In Majuro they live in a small cluster of homes along the coast three pandanus trees planted out back because their roots run deep and supposedly hold down the soil When the leaves rattle in the ocean breeze they sound like rain Sunsets electrify the clouds all pink and orange and a full moon makes the water shimmer at night, Smiley ukulele music is almost always within earshot, Compare that with Arkansas where you climb a gravel staircase to reach the second floor apartment Inside curtains are drawn all day and the lights are always out in part because half the family works the night shift at the chicken packing plant and because they re trying to save electricity On the few days I spent time there most people seemed to be watching TV or playing video games They don t eat together because of their opposite schedules Dinner s often ramen, In the Marshall Islands it would be rice and reef fish served whole the eye staring at you Angie got onto me for cringing about the eye and for apologizing to a fish before I peeled its skin off Breadfruit and pandanus a mustard colored fruit that tastes like a mango merged with an avocado are Marshallese staples, There s a Marshallese grocery store in Springdale but it s stocked only when the owner takes trips to the islands bringing the merchandise in a cooler that she checks on the flight The shelves are half empty and the store doesn t carry breadfruit or pandanus They rot a clerk told me and there s not enough demand, Look harder though and there are similarities, Take religion Almost everyone in the Marshall Islands is Christian Angie and her family are Seventh Day Adventists and there are churches for them in both locations I m told actually that there are more than Marshallese churches near Springdale all of them offering services in the Marshallese language, Then there are the big little things like sleeping arrangements Many of the family members in the Marshall Islands sleep on thatched mats rather than mattresses but in both places the families sleep stacked next to each other In the Springdale apartment kids sleep in a room where three mattresses are arranged side by side, I m used to sleeping with my children and my nieces my nephews on the same mattress with me said Cynthia Riklon Angie s sister who s living in Arkansas, You have to hold them, Especially when they re so far from home, There s an intense sense of longing hanging over Springdale, First birthday parties or kemems are often bigger than weddings in the Marshall Islands, That s especially true for older generations Take people like Cynthia who never left the Marshall Islands until she came here She wouldn t have done it she told me if not for her kids The Marshall Islands especially with the floods was no longer safe for them she told me When they re grown up when they ve finished school and don t need her so close she wants to move back to the islands, But her kids she wants them to put down roots here where it s safe, People like Cynthia do little things to hold onto what makes them Marshallese I met Rumina Lakmis from the sitting at an office desk in the building that houses the consulate Flip flops are that line for her During the cold winter you see the American people all cuddled up with their scarves and sweaters and things she said And me I wear my flip flops all winter See she said pointing down to her feet It s my Marshallese culture, I don t feel Marshallese if I wear boots, I met another Marshallese man in Springdale Edison Maddison who told me he lies on the floor at night with all the lights off and stares at a small aquarium in the living room A blue cheeked fish swims in circles illuminated by a single bulb, The sight transports him back to the ocean back home, I tried to bring a piece of the islands back with me too in the form of a video clip of Angie and her family in Majuro standing on a sea wall they constructed after the March flood It s twilight dark enough I had to shine a spotlight on the group to get their images to show up on camera I promised them I d show it to their stateside family members John Angie s nephew plays the ukulele, Angie chose the song God bless Marshall Islands, It s a farewell tune I m told Appropriate for a funeral, It s a plea in a sense, See us God, We re down here too, Two first birthdays, A child s first birthday or kemem is perhaps the most significant celebration in the Marshallese culture These parties are bigger than weddings Historically many infants did not live through their first year never reached maturity, So a kemem is a rite of passage and a celebration of survival A hope for longevity and happiness, I was fortunate enough to be invited to kemems in Majuro and Springdale, In Majuro I walked down an aisle of tiki torches with Angie Timothy and their cousin Darrell to find one of the most joyously random scenes I ve encountered Some people eating singing and dancing in a courtyard on a tropical evening There was a banner featuring three photos of the baby intermixed with those of unicorn ponies a cake with an icing portrait of the year old a cupcake tower two bands and tubs of rice so big two people had to carry them, Plus a chief Looking very Godfather, It was easily the most lavish birthday party I ve attended and it s been a while but I m pretty sure it would compete with some episodes of I mostly spent my time there running around collecting photos and video clips but at one point the very kind and happy to be photographed family of the year old insisted I sit down to eat And they didn t want me to eat just a little bit, They wanted me to eat a tray of food as wide as a beach ball, Angie s cousin Darrell helped me identify what I didn t recognize Here s what we spotted organized into two or three layers with rice and spaghetti on the bottom sea turtle grilled pandanus fruit cooked in coconut milk sushi sashimi fish here often is consumed raw fried chicken spare ribs coconut meat potato salad parrot fish grilled breadfruit grilled pumpkin cooked in coconut oil breadfruit cooked underground fresh breadfruit so much breadfruit fruit salad fried noodles turtle intestines boiled banana and a hot dog, Again all on one plate, I sat there for a minute picking at the food and watching dancers in matching floral shirts squat and twist and pump their arms as if doing push ups in the air I smelled the sweet heavy air felt the sweat on my skin Saw the lights dangling from the breadfruit and pandanus trees the year old clapping and cooing as people lined up to put bills in her pink inflatable swimming pool I couldn t imagine all this this celebration this hope for a year old child s bright future this food this party this land this life the nation vanishing beneath saltwater, Land is identity in the Marshall Islands, What happens if the land is gone, The Arkansas kemem took place at an indoor event space next to a Demolition Derby at the Rodeo of the Ozarks I saw two Marshallese kids standing at the fence fingers wrapped around the chain links Car engines roared under the stadium lighting, Going to the kemem I asked, No, They were transfixed by the cars, Inside the air conditioner was set to degrees Fahrenheit and a mechanical breeze fluttered balloons affixed to banquet style tables The room had a pitched roof and concrete floor Portraits of white guys in cowboy hats adorned the back wall There were about people some in traditional Marshallese dress floral prints headbands flip flops Others wore jogger jeans and high top sneakers, Yeah there were a variety of foods, But chicken seemed like the main course, And only one kid danced, I talked to several people about the steadily increasing migration of folks to Arkansas Do you think it will pick up as climate change continues, What do you think will happen to the islands, There s always Arkansas said Mahku Moghaddam offering a consolation to the sinking nation They re all welcome here, Many of the Marshallese people came here of course for better jobs better schools better lives Those were factors for Angie s family who moved here too on top of the floods I don t begrudge them any of that But I worry this is a window into the future a future when many Marshallese people will be here not because they choose to be but because they have to be Because their country no longer exists, Standing there in landlocked Springdale I thought of Angie and her family on the coast in the Marshall Islands They re considering leaving their country too and for a mix of reasons as is always the case partly the floods and partly their family in the States But they would hate this event I m sure No breadfruit no pandanus, Air conditioners give Angie the chills, In the back of the room I chatted with three teenagers who had headphones jammed in their ears and smartphones stuck to their faces I asked a kid in a Chicago Bulls hat what he thought about climate change It s all right he said in that yeah whatever SNL parody of Justin Bieber sort of way, Like sure Who cares, Not my problem, Or more accurately Not my experience, I m not going to entertain that question, I have a confession to make Maybe I m the worst person to be telling you the story of the Marshall Islands I m from a country the United States that is helping raise sea levels worldwide and that conducted nuclear testing here I flew on a plane to get here emitting pounds of carbon dioxide in the process and that s just one way I grew up in a state Oklahoma represented by Sen Jim Inhofe one of the country s most vocal climate skeptics He recently to show that no obviously global warming isn t happening I mean lookie here There s snow, Such buffoonery is so shameful I felt embarrassed to be in the Marshall Islands asking people questions about where they d move, I was glad when someone finally pushed back, When people ask that it feels like defeat told me very matter of fact And I don t want to feel defeated I don t want to entertain that question I think people should be saying What can we do to help instead of saying When will you go, Or where will you go, I have to agree with her, If you bundle up all the Pacific countries they contribute from fossil fuels according to a study cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, These islands aren t causing this problem, And because of that they re powerless to save themselves, Not yet underwater, The Marshall Islands is a place of stories, Passed down by word of mouth so they won t disappear, During my brief time in the islands I met people like Angie who are witnessing climate change and who are trying to do what s best for themselves and their families By sharing their stories they hope the rest of us might listen might realize our actions have consequences for places we ll never see for people we ll never meet I also had the pleasure of meeting Kathy Jetnil Kijiner a young mother and poet who has emerged as one of the country s pre eminent storytellers A teacher at the College of the Marshall Islands the year old also studies the oral stories that form the fabric of her nation and culture, Video poem Two degrees is a gamble, She told me two of her favorites and one of her own, It seems fitting to let her stories serve as the end of mine, The first is the story of the Ripako or shark clan who are Kathy s distant relatives on her mother s side True to their name legend has it this group of people could communicate with sharks They formed a sort of uneasy alliance with the tides too Instead of doing rain dances as would have been common in North America they held ceremonies on the reef aimed at willing the tide into equilibrium and keeping large waves from destroying their homes and flooding them out, This conversation with the sharks and with the water helped them thrive in the harsh environment that always has been the Marshall Islands, Theirs is a story of resourcefulness and survival, The second story is one of neglect, It s the legend of a boy who lost his mother and the evil stepmother who replaced her evil stepmothers predate Disney apparently The stepmother didn t provide the boy with enough food nor the mat to use as clothing nor a kite woven from leaves so he could play She was cruel and uncaring not noticing how her decisions pushed the child toward depression and sadness He had a strong spirit but was unable to provide for himself The boy suffered in silence afraid to complain to his stepmother or father who didn t notice or didn t care either, One day however the boy was out fishing with his father When his father dived beneath the waves after a fish a bird appeared and started talking to the boy, It was his mother reincarnated, Why are you crying the bird asked her son, No reason the boy said, The bird pecked at the son for lying to her And when the father re emerged from the waves the bird flew away, This scene repeated itself three times before the boy had the courage to tell the truth That his stepmother and father weren t feeding him that he had no mat no kite He finally gained the courage to confront his father and stepmother about this too When he stood up for himself his mother the bird returned She appreciated his quiet respectful resistance to injustice so she turned the boy into a bird The boy bird flew away from his father and the evil stepmother forever changed, The father died in sorrow searching for his lost son If only he had noticed the trouble sooner had recognized the severity of the situation, Then maybe he could have saved his son, And himself, How to help save the Marshall Islands, From reducing your carbon footprint to urging leaders stop warming short of degrees for future generations, Kathy s own story seems influenced by those of her ancestors, She has emerged as a clarion moral voice on climate change shouting into the wind from these distant islands I first met her at a climate change rally in New York last fall about how she doesn t want her now year old daughter Peinam who is named after a patch of land on a distant atoll in the Marshall Islands to grow up without a country, They say you your daughter and your granddaughter too will wander rootless with only a passport to call home she says in the poem which is written to her daughter No one s drowning baby no one s moving no one s losing their homeland no one s gonna become a climate change refugee Kathy told me she hoped that speech and the poem would wake the world up that her story and the story of her islands could be the antidote to apathy and the chill of ignorance, There are small signs the world is listening The Pope is taking a firm stance on climate to reduce emissions The Guardian and org are trying to make people see, People who watch international climate negotiations closely however say none of it is enough not yet to keep the world below degrees of warming, In other words likely not enough to save the Marshall Islands, Kathy tries not to get discouraged but she does, She keeps answering the same questions from reporters, Keeps telling her story once then again, Hoping someone will hear, Someone will act, On my last morning in the Marshall Islands the young mom and I went to a beach in Majuro to film a reading of a poem she wrote for CNN called degrees, There are people there are faces all the way out here she said waves crashing on a reef behind her sun tucked behind a cloud There is a baby walking wobbly stomping squeaky yellow light up shoes across the edge of the reef, She paused, Not yet underwater]}}

reporting on a tiny number that may have a huge effect on the future He d like your help Subscribe to the or follow him on and He s jdsutter on Snapchat, We Americans don t know much about climate change, That s one of my takeaways from in the United States, I met smart thoughtful people who think hairspray contributes to global warming or that wind farms pollute more than oil Neither is true of course, I m convinced one reason for this confusion and misinformation is that we Americans aren t talking about this issue not enough The silence that surrounds global warming not only means that we don t understand the causes and impacts of climate change which to be fair are superconfusing but also that we don t understand each other and how we view this issue as individuals and a nation, I ll count myself as part of the problem here Before I started looking into how and why Americans shape their views on climate I had tons of silly misconceptions, To clear things up here s a question quiz to see how well you understand the basics of climate change and how it plays out in American life today, I d encourage you to share the results on social media and start a conversation there about how and why climate science matters to the future of the planet, This quiz is part of You can help shape the coverage or to learn more, Let s say you re at a party with all the world s working climate scientists If you were able to poll each of them what percentage of the scientists would tell you climate change is real and we humans are causing it, Multiple studies published in peer reviewed scientific journals show that or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree Climate warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities In addition most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position, What percentage of Americans know the answer to Question, According to the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication So if you got Question right hooray You re in the hyperenlightened Go tell a friend, In the United States what is the biggest contributor to climate change, But it s close Thirty one percent of U S greenhouse gas emissions come from burning coal gas and oil for electricity compared to for transportation like driving cars, When it comes to information about climate change which person or group of people are Americans more likely to say they trust, Sixty seven percent of Americans strongly or somewhat trust family and friends for information about global warming released in March Only trust Pope Francis who this summer released an encyclical on the moral injustice of climate change for that sort of information Perhaps surprisingly climate scientists are the most trusted group followed by other kinds of scientists TV weather reporters and personal primary care doctors Only a few of you likely are primary care doctors but I bet all of you qualify as family or friends to someone Use that as an excuse to start a conversation, Which country would you say is more skeptical of climate science, The United States has the reputation for being an international laggard on climate change but this country isn t the world s most skeptical Australia has the highest proportion of skeptics at followed by Norway New Zealand and the USA write the authors of a May study published in Global Environmental Change At the other extreme only of the Spanish and of Germans and Swiss are climate skeptics while the proportion of skeptics in all other countries is only or less The authors looked at industrialized countries, What percentage of Americans do you think would say they are either extremely or very sure that climate change, The same percentage of Americans also believe vaccines are more dangerous than disease In other words It s a fringe view Neither view for the record is supported by science Those numbers come from the, Which of these Republican candidates for the U S presidency has said climate change is real is caused by people and is a problem, Sen Lindsey Graham from South Carolina has acknowledged the reality of climate science Graham who is not a front runner helped write bipartisan climate legislation in and before withdrawing his support according to new reports I know I m not a scientist but here s the problem I ve got with some people in my party When you ask the scientists what s going on why don t you believe them If I went to doctors and nine said Hey you re gonna die and one says You re fine why would I believe the one guy Donald Trump the real estate tycoon and reality TV star meanwhile that he is not a huge believer in the global warming phenomenon, Which country has contributed the most overall to climate change, Since the according to the World Resources Institute Pretty soon China likely will pass the United States as the world s largest contributor to climate change and already emits more carbon dioxide per year than the United States But thinking about these numbers in the longer term makes sense They tell us how much each country is to blame for the warming already locked into place, We re hearing a lot about climate change in the news this year First there was Then which aims to cut power plant emissions considerably But, Three quarters of Americans say they rarely or never hear someone they know talk about climate change And it s getting worse over time In of people surveyed said they talked rarely or never about climate change which is considerably lower This is a huge problem People are likely to trust the views of their family and friends on this important topic but fewer are speaking up, Speaking of the Clean Power Plan you may have heard it s controversial because it proposes cutting back on coal for power generation and ramping up renewable energy use in the United States It s likely to get stuck in a legal battle But what percentage of Americans support strict emissions limits on coal power plants, Seven in Americans support setting strict carbon dioxide emission limits on existing coal fired plants to reduce global warming and improve public health even though the cost of electricity would likely increase according to a survey from Yale University and George Mason University published in support that type of action which is the basis of the Clean Power Plan, Follow us

the East and West and we see incredible potential for significant investment in relatively new markets for us such as China and Russia, talked about the topic of diversification Lower oil prices is a job for all the GCC countries but I believe the UAE is in a very good position The GCC has turned from a net exporter to a net importer of capital with this focus on IPOs and privatisations We are seeing here a very important change, Talking about Brexit commented It is too soon to say what will happen with Brexit Why Because there is no strategy Neither from the British or European side The British haven t decided what they want It was easy to vote no but the question is to vote how to do it It is not clear how to do it Frankly nobody knows in London, And on the US election result said President Elect Trump needs to adapt to the world and the world needs to adapt to him In economic terms investors are mainly happy about what he has announced so far less regulation lower taxes and huge programme of infrastructure There is a question mark though on trade where his rhetoric has been extremely negative I believe that if the agenda of President Elect Trump is an agenda about growth then he cannot do it without trade, Chairwoman Media Zone Authority Abu Dhabi and twofour said twofour Abu Dhabi s content creation hub and the Tourism and Culture Authority Abu Dhabi are working to

Cambodia with Oscar winning actress and UNODC Goodwill Ambassador against Human Trafficking Mira Sorvino The result was Every Day in Cambodia A CNN Freedom Project Documentary which looked at child sex trafficking in the country, Just this month it was named outstanding documentary by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation winning a Gracie Allen award, Sorvino says the film has raised awareness of the issue helping to raise funds to build a school that when completed will offer hope for more than children in the region, Primary and especially secondary education is extremely important in preventing trafficking she says It allows children to develop critical thinking skills to be able to defend themselves from traffickers and to have the skills that will enable them to have gainful employment to be able to support their families in other ways than being sexually exploited, But Sorvino adds that it s not just about helping the victims The demand side really needs to be addressed she says If people weren t trying to buy child sex it wouldn t be being sold, Today tens of millions of people are enslaved worldwide, It s a global problem affecting people on every continent and for the last four years The CNN Freedom Project has been shining a light on modern day slavery, Here we look back at the Freedom Project so far remembering some of the stories we have covered and looking ahead at what still needs to be done, I have an year old daughter and as a mother would risk everything to keep her safe So today I shuddered to learn that a Minnesota based nonprofit just rescued a year old girl from sex trafficking, The good news She s now safe The bad news There are countless more like her But with the passage of we are now able to provide shelter services and a safe haven to help this girl and others like her, Where I live isn t India which has the largest number of people in modern slavery million according to the It s Minnesota largely Scandinavian the setting of Garrison Keillor s Lake Wobegon, But here and around the world girls and boys are falling prey to human traffickers, A van and a set of benches In the global fight to end human trafficking they are probably not the first weapons that come to mind, But on the ground in places like Cambodia and India anti trafficking advocates say these are tools are at the top of their wish lists, We have over children in our school from different areas of the community Some children have dropped out because they lack transportation says Julie Harrold director of U S operations at AIM Parents don t want their children walking to school because the roads are dangerous and kids are propositioned on the way to school, Now there s a way to help from anywhere in the world, a documentary that examines the plight of farm laborers in the U S releases to the American public on Friday CNN asked its director Sanjay Rawal about the movie and how it came to be made, Do you care about who grows your food and in what conditions these farm laborers work, A new movie called releases in the U S on Friday, The documentary produced by actress Eva Longoria and narrated by Oscar winner Forest Whitaker examines working conditions for laborers harvesting tomatoes in Immokalee Florida and grapes in California s wine region Napa Valley, It follows the fight of some laborers taking on big business interests to establish their rights, The film premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and recently played at the Napa Valley Film Festival and by the certainly prompted strong debate, In the past few months the world has witnessed horrific accounts of the enslavement of thousands of innocent Yazidis and other religious minorities by ISIS partisans in Iraq and Syria, In a recent article in its online English language magazine ISIS ideologues offered legal justifications for the enslavement of these non Muslim non combatants stating that enslaving the families of the kuffar infidels and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah or Islamic law, The article argues based on a variety of Shariah sources that ISIS partisans have a religious duty to kill or enslave members of the Yazidi community as part of their struggle jihad against their enemies, This argument is plainly wrong hypocritical and astonishingly ahistorical relying on male fantasies inspired by stories from the days of imperial Islam, It is also an affront to right thinking Muslims everywhere and a criminal perversion of Islamic law particularly its primary source the Glorious Quran, Jana was a year old in her final year of high school with dreams of becoming a doctor Then ISIS came to her village last August, She described to me in chilling detail how the jihadis first demanded that members of her Yazidi religious minority convert to Islam Then they stripped villagers of their jewelry money and cellphones They separated the men from the women, A United Nations report explained what happened next ISIS gathered all the males older than years of age at the local school took them outside the village by pick up trucks and shot them, Among those believed dead were Jana s father and eldest brother, A different fate lay in store for the women, They work on U S construction sites and farms in restaurants and hotels even in homes, Foreign workers lured by false promises of good jobs in America soon find themselves enslaved in plain sight as victims of labor trafficking according to a new report published by the nonpartisan Urban Institute and Northeastern University, Imagine being rescued from modern slavery only to be charged with a crime, That s the apparent reality in Mauritania the country with the world s highest incidence of modern slavery Located in West Africa on the edge of the Sahara Desert an estimated to of people there remain enslaved It was the last country in the world to abolish the practice in And it only criminalized owning humans in, So perhaps this latest news should come as no surprise, Mbeirika Mint M bareck a year old girl was rescued from slavery only to be subsequently charged with having sex outside of marriage according to a letter activists drafted on her behalf It is unclear who fathered the child That crime is potentially punishable by death by stoning according to an expert I spoke with The activists planned to send the letter to the country s ministry of justice on Monday, The Nobel Peace Prize for is awarded to India s Kailash Satyarthi and Pakistan s for their struggles against the suppression of children and for young people s rights including the right to education, Thorbjorn Jagland chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee said Children must go to school not be financially exploited, Yousafzai came to global attention after she was shot in the head by the Taliban two years ago Thursday for her efforts to promote education for girls in Pakistan

byproduct of how we live It s also about where we live Just ask the residents of these cities, A truly healthy city makes it easy for residents to adopt a healthful lifestyle whether it s by providing quality health care encouraging preventive medicine or reducing air pollution These cities top our list because they shine in one or more areas of good health, The leaders of these cities have implemented laws and policies that ensure locals have access to parks nutritious food and public transportation They ve created innovative programs to combat disease and increased the quality of life for residents long into old age, But of course good health isn t just up to the government Citizen engagement is also crucial when it comes to creating a healthy community, In response to a query from residents of Napa California and other cities around the globe told us how their city inspires good health and why they strive to make wellness a priority From line dancing to surfing rivers to life size games of chess they show us that staying active doesn t have to be a chore, So take a quick trip around the globe with The CNN and pick up a tip or two from these healthy cities Your body and mind will thank you, Where happiness is the truth, By CNN, Copenhagen is a bustling city full of ambitious professionals and young families Yet working long hours here is frowned upon, Just of employees in Copenhagen work hours a week or more according to freeing them up to spend time with family join organized sports volunteer or participate in other community programs, The cost to participate in those programs which range from laughter yoga in the park to basket weaving Free This helps encourage residents to get involved, Their ability to balance work with quality time with friends and family not only keeps their stress levels down it gives them a happiness boost Studies show that people who focus on experiences versus things have higher levels of satisfaction long after the moment has passed That s one reason Denmark takes the top spot as in the annual commissioned by the United Nations, Other things play into Copenhagen s relaxed atmosphere Residents walk to restaurants and walk to get groceries There are outdoor food markets with fresh produce and vegetables within a few blocks of most spots in the city, Men cycle to work in their slim fit suits and women don t shy away from pairing a bike helmet with their sundresses and wedge heels The city has miles of bike paths which makes biking an easy and safe option And people use them in Copenhagen travel to work or school by bike each day, Though parks and bike paths are plentiful the government is upping its efforts By all residents must be able to reach a park or beach by foot in less than minutes according to a new official municipal policy Many of the new parks created will be pocket parks or small green spaces for city residents The hope is that they will help keep residents fit and help the environment by reducing traffic and pollution, Here s one more stat that may make you want to start packing your bags for Denmark Ninety six percent of residents in Copenhagen say they can count on someone if they are in need, This supportive society is just another reason Copenhagen earns a spot as one of the healthiest and happiest cities, Land of the elders, By CNN, When Ponce de Leon was searching for the Fountain of Youth in the th century the Spanish explorer should have aimed his boat toward Japan instead of Florida Okinawa Prefecture has the longest lived population in the world, Life expectancy for women in Okinawa is for men it s That s than the average life expectancy for men worldwide and years longer than the average life expectancy for women, Okinawa also has

population Okinawans overall quality of life is good, is routine as is a lean diet Consequently their body mass index is low with an average of to is rich in green and yellow vegetables sweet potatoes soy and fish, Okinawans They drink in moderation and few smoke, Okinawans also tend to stay socially connected They often live in the same houses as their extended families Okinawan culture respects the elderly Centenarians tend to be optimistic adaptable independent creative calm and easygoing all personality traits associated with longevity, Doctors think we could learn a lot about healthy aging from Okinawans, Low stress strong family bonds optimism studies show these factors are important and I ve noticed this helps with my own patients said director of the Division of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center, Okinawans also tend to work as long as they can he said, We ve seen when you matter in society when you think beyond yourself when you don t let your brain retire that s all very helpful, Bright future for babies, By CNN, Casinos race cars luxury yachts and healthy babies, Monte Carlo in the tiny European country of Monaco has the with an estimated deaths per live births That s mostly because the country s reports wide health care coverage in the city with a focus on prevention education and screening, Quality care during pregnancy in addition to safe and clean delivery by a skilled attendant and immediate postnatal care has been shown to prevent infant mortality according to the, Countries like Monaco have high technology equipment that works and staff highly specialized in working it said Vivian Barnekow Child and Adolescent Health and Development program manager at the WHO s European office In principle it s fairly easy to prevent infant mortality if you have the infrastructure for high quality care, The amount of wealth in the country certainly helps Monaco ranks fifth in the world for highest gross domestic product per capita the CIA s reports, According to the children in the poorest of the population in the world are twice as likely to die before their first birthday compared with children in the richest, The big thing is that Monaco is a very wealthy city state said Dr Edward McCabe senior vice president and chief medical officer at We know that prematurity which is a leading cause of infant mortality is influenced overall by poverty and lack of access to medical care, He says Monaco has three times the physicians per capita as the United States so access to them isn t a problem, No matter what your ethnicity if you have full access to health care your baby is going to have higher probability of being born healthy McCabe says, Fortunately you don t have to give birth in the French Riviera to reduce the risk of infant mortality The recommends that any mother to be take folic acid supplements eat a healthy diet exercise and get appropriate prenatal care, Take a deep breath, By CNN, If you were to get on Interstate near the Mexican border and drive north through Los Angeles Sacramento Portland and Seattle the first stoplight you d encounter would be in Canada just inside Vancouver s city limits, That s because I ends just south of Vancouver British Columbia making it the only major city in North America without an interstate running through it says Deputy City Manager Sadhu Johnston, With a dense downtown a strong public transportation system and miles of bike lanes it s the most walkable city in Canada Johnston says, The shift away from a car centered culture in one reason the city also has some of, Other reasons include strict environmental standards for buildings and businesses and a natural environment marked by evergreen forests and ocean breezes that helps purify air pollutants, Air quality is a good indicator for health in any city says Janice Nolen assistant vice president for national policy at the American Lung Association Pollution can kill people she says It can shorten lives by days to months, It can cause heart attacks and strokes asthma in children low birth weight and of course lung cancer, Car emissions are a major source of these pollutants that people who live close to a busy highway breathe in many more particles and harmful chemicals than those who don t Nolen says, In Vancouver adopted the Greenest City Action Plan which aims to make the Canadian metro area the most environmentally friendly city in the world, Vancouver s leaders have done a lot to protect and celebrate its natural environment Johnston says Residents have easy access to acres of green space fresh water the ocean and nearby mountains, At the same time businesses and government have collaborated to build up downtown As a result there has been about a increase in the number of people who live and work in Vancouver s center in the past years which means fewer commuters driving in and out of the city, Overall Vancouver has seen a reduction in its carbon emissions since Johnston says despite a nearly growth in population and an growth in jobs He says the city has showed that you can create a clean and green environment without impacting your quality of life and your economy, Fit and friendly, By CNN, Livability means different things to different people But Melbourne s quality of life is something most can agree on, Last month for the fourth year in a row this Australian coastal metropolis was named by the Economist Intelligence Unit which researches and ranks places around the globe in a number of categories, Melbourne topped the cities surveyed by scoring well across a number of criteria including low crime rates excellent health care and education tolerance of different ethnicities religions and lifestyles and a bounty of cultural and sporting activities such as tennis Australian Open, All this in a glittering bayside setting with a meandering river opulent architecture lots of green space and a temperate climate not unlike San Diego s, The reason Melbourne does so well in our survey is that it presents so few challenges to someone s daily lifestyle says Jon Copestake a EIU analyst and editor of the annual livability report which crunches data from the World Bank and other sources, In other words the city is clean safe and welcoming without the bitter weather overburdened infrastructure or civil unrest that plague some other urban centers, has an extensive network of rail lines and streetcars for example along with a bicycle sharing system that makes it easy to get around without a car Considered by many the cultural capital of Australia it s also got a thriving arts scene, But can a city really enhance someone s mental health Yes says Jeff Risom a partner at which designs public spaces that boost wellness Risom believes that cities with more parks squares trains and cultural happenings offer their residents more opportunities for social interaction which makes them happier, We re social creatures he says, Maybe that s one reason Melbourne was named the friendliest city on the planet along with Auckland New Zealand last month, The long term future of this former gold rush boomtown is less clear Melbourne is Australia s fastest growing city and runaway growth often brings congestion crime and other urban ills, But for now it s a beautiful and healthful place to live, Hey smokers Butt out, By CNN, In many respects New York does not feel like a healthy place It s noisy and crowded and pedestrians court danger every time they step off a curb Residents must battle the constant stress that comes with sharing a finite urban space with million other people, But if you re sensitive to cigarette smoke it s a form of paradise Among big cities New York has been a steadfast pioneer in cracking down on smoking, It began nearly two decades ago when the city recognized the hazards of secondhand smoke by passing a law prohibiting smoking in workplaces In Mayor Michael Bloomberg extended the smoking ban to include almost all bars and restaurants sparking an outcry that gradually subsided as under the new law, The ban appeared to dampen New Yorkers appetite for cigarettes A survey by the city s health department found that from to the number of adult residents who reported smoking declined by Over roughly the same period the smoking rate among New York high school students plummeted by, Health officials say that even people exposed to low levels of secondhand smoke can develop the same type of lung problems seen in regular smokers So in Bloomberg took the anti tobacco fight outdoors with a bill that made it illegal to smoke in city parks on beaches and on pedestrian plazas, There are very few places left to legally smoke says Christine Johnson assistant commissioner for the Bureau of Chronic Disease Prevention and Tobacco Control at the city s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene We want to make it easier for people to quit, City leaders also have A law that took effect in May raised the legal age for buying cigarettes and tobacco products from to At the same time the city hiked the sales tax on tobacco by law a pack of cigarettes must sell for at least the second highest price in the nation, The city s next public health cause may be a ban on electronic cigarettes which are not regulated by the FDA, New York has always been a leader in tobacco control says Deidre Sully deputy director of the a program of Public Health Solutions One of our main messages is that smoke free policies are not about villainizing smokers but acknowledging the right of all New Yorkers to breathe clean smoke free air, Good for Esther good for all seniors, By CNN, The number of people reaching the age of will increase exponentially in the Western world over the next couple of decades Governments will need systems that not only provide good quality care for the elderly but that are sustainable long term, Leaders could learn a lot by making the trip to the city of Jonkoping in southern Sweden and asking What s good for Esther, Esther is a reasonably self sufficient elderly pensioner with some chronic health issues She has friends in the area and a daughter in the town next to Jonkoping but spends an increasing amount of time alone in her small apartment, Esther is years old She always has been and always will be, That s because Esther is an imaginary person dreamed up by a group of government administrators to help them think through problems in the life of the elderly The result became known as the, Sweden on quality of life for the elderly by many measures says Andrew Scharlach professor of aging at the University of California School of Social Welfare including income security life expectancy psychological well being employment and education, It is a good system says Goran Henriks chief executive of learning and innovation for Jonkoping But there s always room for improvement, When Henriks and his team asked what would happen if Esther called her daughter complaining of chest pains they found that Esther was shuffled from place to place for hours subjected to redundant tests and long waits and asked nearly identical questions by as many as people, Asking What s good for Esther led to new policy says Henriks that would have Esther attended to by a local nurse and resting at home for a few days before going to the hospital for an outpatient procedure far less taxing both on the system and on Esther, Over the long term Henriks says the Esther Project has resulted in a uniquely streamlined and integrated program of care for the elderly in Jonkoping that has been very successful sometimes in surprising ways One unexpected result was a big reduction in the need for hospital beds in the region which was a huge cost savings for the area, Esther now has ageless siblings throughout the country says Henriks Kersti Helga Nisse Linnea Herman Britta all helping to improve life for the elderly in Sweden, An ounce of prevention, By CNN, It may seem unlikely but Havana Cuba is one of the healthiest cities on the planet, Yes much of the country is in abject poverty and the trade embargo by the United States has kept some of the best medical technologies out of health care workers hands But a focus on prevention has helped many residents avoid the hospital altogether, Consider these facts Cuba a country with million people has an average life expectancy of years the same as the life expectancy in the United States The infant mortality rate is actually better than in America And the Cuban government spends an average of just per person on health care the United States spends close to, How One word prevention, Fundamentally prevention is how you keep your costs down says Pierre LaRamee the executive director of MEDICC a nonprofit cooperative medical effort between the United States and Cuba If you re a country with very limited resources like Cuba you put all of your resources into the most effective most low cost interventions, Simple things like a near vaccination rate and regular health screenings help Every community has a network of small doctors offices in nearby homes and free access to neighborhood polyclinics, Larger tertiary care hospitals are reserved for the most complicated cases and problems that can be headed off early in the small clinics are dealt with locally, Taking care of yourself and your neighbors is a practice that everyone is taught from a young age in Havana says LaRamee Kids are taught basic first aid and CPR which is important in an area that s often in the path of many hurricanes and where emergency medical services are scarce, If people are trained early on to think about their overall health the need for proper nutrition the need for exercise that creates a culture of health LaRamee says, Another effect of the government s focus on preventive care Medical school is free and Cuba trains more doctors than any other Latin American country, Some critics point out that doctors make between and per month about the same as everyone else and are often forced to take side jobs as taxi drivers to earn extra money Treatment for more complicated or rare diseases is often nonexistent and of the adult male population still smokes, All of that said

behavioral sciences at the Morehouse School of Medicine who specializes in health disparities, Quality health programs pay attention to the needs of the people being served she says They have
